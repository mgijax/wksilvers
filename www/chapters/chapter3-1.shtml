This change in the color of the pigment granule is accompanied by a change in its size and shape. Brown granules are significantly smaller than black granules and display much less variation in size (E.

Because of these differences it has been judged that intensely pigmented brown phenotypes have only slightly more than one-third the volume of pigment of intensely pigmented black mice (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell2">E.

Effects of <I>b</I>-Locus Alleles on Tyrosinase Activity</H3><P>The effect of genic substitution at the <I>b</I>-locus on tyrosinase activity has been well investigated (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell34">L.

The study of Coleman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>) is particularly pertinent inasmuch as he measured the incorporation of <SUP>14</SUP>C-labeled tyrosine into <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>b</I>, <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/<I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>, <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b<SUP>c</SUP></I>/<I>b<SUP>c</SUP></I>, and <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I> skin. Whereas brown skin incorporated about twice as much tyrosine as black (<I>B</I>/<I>B</I> or <I>B</I>/<I>b</I>) skin and light skin, cordovan skin was intermediate between black and brown in its uptake (<a href="javascript:windowt31 = window.open('../tables/table3-1.shtml', 'windowt31', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt31.focus()">Table 3-1</A>). Moreover, to rule out the possibility that these paradoxical findings were a consequence of the <I>in vitro</I> assay employed (see <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster2">Foster, 1959</A>) Coleman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>) measured the uptake of tyrosine when injected into 4-day-old <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> and <I>B</I>/<I>B</I> mice and obtained similar results. This <I>in vivo</I> study also indicated that brown granules develop as rapidly as black granules so that the increased activity of <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> skin cannot be attributed to the fact that brown granules develop more slowly and hence retain more active tyrosinase sites on their surface (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick2">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>).<A NAME="3IE"></A><H3>E. Site of <I>b</I>-Locus Activity</H3><P>To pinpoint the stage in the development of the melanosome when the <I>b</I>-locus is believed to operate requires a brief description of the "normal" development of this organelle. According to Moyer (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer1">1961</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer2">1963</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">1966</A> melanosome development is initiated when thin "unit fibers," often contiguous with polysomes, aggregate to form "compound fibers" within a membranous boundary. As these fibers cross-link and become oriented parallel to each other the shape of the melanosome<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#3">3</A></SUP> becomes apparent and melanin is deposited at definite sites along the fibers of its matrix.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#4">4</A></SUP> This deposition of melanin continues so that ultimately the details of the matrix of the melanosome are obscured by the electron dense pigment. When melanin synthesis ceases the melanosome represents a typical mature pigment granule.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#5">5</A></SUP><P>Observations of <I>B</I>/&#151; and <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> granules indicate that it is during that stage of melanosome development when melanin is deposited at discrete sites along the fibers of its matrix that the <I>b</I>-locus operates. Thus Moyer (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer1">1961</A>) observed that when melanin was just beginning to be deposited, the second-order periodicity in black granules was longer (about 200 A) than the second-order periodicity of brown granules (about 113 A). If this second-order periodicity represents the active site of tyrosinase activity, the shorter distance between sites in brown granules would allow for a greater number of sites for this activity and, hence, for the greater overall tyrosinase activity of <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> skin. Thus, according to this scheme, subunits of the protein controlled by the <I>b</I>-locus are possibly involved in the formation of the parallel fibers of the melanosome which bind tyrosinase in a certain fixed ratio (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe6">Wolfe and Coleman, 1966</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#6">6</A></SUP><P>The <I>b</I>-locus also influences the size and shape of the pigment granule as well as the final molecular structure of the melanin deposited. When viewed under the electron microscope, the melanin in mature brown granules is flocculent and coarsely granular, whereas that of black granules is very finely granular, almost appearing homogeneous (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">Moyer, 1966</A>) (see <a href="javascript:windowf31 = window.open('../figures/figure3-1.shtml', 'windowf31', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf31.focus()">Figure 3-1</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#7">7</A></SUP> It therefore appears that the protein produced by the <I>b</I>-locus not only must provide a structural framework for the attachment of tyrosinase but also must somehow affect its activity.<A NAME="3IF"></A><H3>F.

She observed that sections of black hair bulb melanocytes contain a mixture of round and elongated melanized bodies suggesting a population of granules round in cross-section and oval in longitudinal section. On the other hand, the granules found in intensely pigmented brown hair bulbs were usually nearly spherical. Rittenhouse also noted that maltese dilution (<I>d</I>/<I>d</I>) (see <A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml">Chapter 4, Section I</A>) influenced the morphology of <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> granules; <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>;<I>d</I>/<I>d</I> granules, like <I>B</I>/&#151; granules, were usually oval in longitudinal section and round in cross-section. Moreover, she observed that whereas the unmelanized <I>B</I>/&#151; granule consists of one or more rolled membranes, the internal framework of <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> granules resemble a tangled ball of strands. Although this last observation contrasts with those of Moyer (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer2">1963</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">1966</A>) who could not find any disruption of the pattern of granule framework in <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> mice, it should be noted that most of his preparations were derived from the pigmented epithelium of the eye rather than from the hair bulb.<P>In an attempt to integrate the mode of action of <I>b</I>-locus alleles, Foster (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster4">1965</A>) has speculated that this locus is the structural gene for a protein the alteration of which can greatly influence the properties of the melanosome.<A NAME="3IG"></A><H3>G.

Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>). <P>Although all the melanocytes in the hair bulb of light mice are clearly dendritic during early stages of the hair growth cycle, some rounded, densely melanized cells deficient in dendrites (known as "nucleopetal" cells &#151; see <A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml#4ID">Chapter 4, Section I, D</A>) are subsequently found in the upper part of the follicle (<a href="javascript:windowf38 = window.open('../figures/figure3-8.shtml', 'windowf38', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf38.focus()">Figure 3-8</A>). The frequency of these cells increases so that the uprooted cells (or portions thereof) which become incorporated into the developing hair shaft also usually lack dendrites, are densely melanized, and may contain pycnotic nuclei (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sweet2">S. Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>). Indeed, as will be reiterated when the effects of the <I>d</I> and <I>ln</I> loci are discussed (<A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml#4ID">Chapter 4, Section I, D</A>), the very fact that nucleopetal melanocytes develop in <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> hair follicles may be responsible for their being uprooted and incorporated into the hair, i.e., a well-developed dendritic system may serve as a mechanical anchor. Why these cells develop, however, is not known. One possibility is that the <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> gene causes follicular melanocytes to produce pigment granules at a faster rate than they can deliver them to keratinocytes and as a consequence the melanocytes enlarge, become detached from their normal matrix positions, and are swept into the hair shaft (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Quevedo8">Quevedo and Chase, 1958</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sweet2">S. Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes3.shtml#9">9</A></SUP> If this mechanism is correct one would expect the rate of melanin synthesis to be reduced in <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> genotypes heterozygous for <I>p</I> (since these animals do <I>not</I> display either nucleopetal melanocytes in their follicles or large clumps of pigment in their hairs). Unfortunately, concrete evidence that this is the case is lacking. Nevertheless, <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/&#151;;<I>p</I>/<I>p</I> as well as yellow-<I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> mice almost certainly have a slower rate of pigment synthesis than <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/&#151;<I>P</I>/<I>P</I> mice and these genotypes also display melanocytes of normal morphology.<A NAME="3IG1"></A><H4>1. Interaction With Leaden and Dilute</H4><P>Since the recessive mutations leaden (<I>ln</I>) and dilute (<I>d</I>) (see <A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml">Chapter 4, Section I</A>) also affect melanocyte morphology by transforming dendritic (nucleofugal) cells into cells with a poorly developed dendritic system (nucleopetal), some mention of how these genes interact with <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>, as well as a comparison of the effect each of these genes has when combined with other coat-color determinants, is germane. Indeed, the results of these interactions demonstrate clearly that the influence <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> has on melanocyte morphology is quite distinct from that of <I>d</I> or <I>ln</I> (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#McGrath1">McGrath and Quevedo, 1965</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sweet2">S. Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>).<P>Inasmuch as <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> hair bulb melanocytes are always nucleopetal, one might anticipate that when <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> is combined with <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/&#151; these nucleopetal cells would aggravate the "diluting" action of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> by accelerating the rate at which melanocytes become incorporated into the hair shaft. This, however, is <I>not</I> the case. Although in <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>d</I>/<I>d</I>;<I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/&#151; mice the morphology of the follicular melanocytes are consistent with their <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> constitution, they do not appear to be lost from the hair bulbs more frequently than those of nondilute light or dark nonagouti mice. Indeed the dynamics of melanocyte behavior in dilute-<I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> mice seems to be more comparable to those of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> heterozygotes than homozygotes (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#McGrath1">McGrath and Quevedo, 1965</A>). This observation is important because it indicates that factors other than melanocyte shape are undoubtedly involved in determining whether melanocytes are dislodged from the hair bulb and incorporated into the septules of the hair (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#McGrath1">McGrath and Quevedo, 1965</A>).<P>Among the observations which indicate the <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> differs from <I>ln</I> and <I>d</I> in the manner in which it influences melanocyte morphology are the following: (1) Whereas <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> has no influence on the morphology of yellow melanocytes, both <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> and <I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I> yellow mice display nucleopetal cells (Poole and Silvers, unpublished); (2) <I>p</I>, even when heterozygous, can influence the morphology and behavior of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>/&#151; melanocytes, whereas this is not the case even when <I>p</I> is homozygous in combination with either <I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I> (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sweet2">S. Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>) or <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> (Poole and Silvers, unpublished); and (3) while the hairs of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> genotypes, particularly homozygotes, become unpigmented prematurely as a consequence of the fact that the melanocytes which are incorporated into the hair are not replaced, this is not the case in <I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I> and <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> animals. Thus, although the melanocytes of leaden and dilute mice are also incorporated periodically into the hair, they appear to be replaced so that a population of follicular melanocytes persists to pigment the entire shaft.<P>Finally it should be noted that in contrast to the situation in <I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I> and <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> genotypes and, indeed, in contradistinction to the situation in <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> hair bulbs, the extrafollicular melanocytes of light mice are usually nucleofugal in morphology. Thus, light melanocytes in the dermis and epidermis of the sole of the foot, ear pinna, scrotum, and tail (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sweet2">S. Sweet and Quevedo, 1968</A>; <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Quevedo5">Quevedo, 1969b</A>), as well as those in the harderian gland (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert4">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>), all display well-developed dendrites (<a href="javascript:windowf39 = window.open('../figures/figure3-9.shtml', 'windowf39', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf39.focus()">Figure 3-9</A>). Why this is the case is not known but one possibility, which will be discussed further when we concern ourselves with the action of genes at the <I>d</I> and <I>ln</I> loci (<A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml#4IE">Chapter 4, Section I, E</A>), is that light melanocytes have an intrinsically greater capacity to develop well-melanized dendrites than either leaden or dilute melanocytes (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Quevedo5">Quevedo, 1969b</A>). In the compact environment of a hair bulb light, leaden and dilute melanocytes are unable to extend their dendrites whereas in less compact extrafollicular locations, light melanocytes, but not dilute or leaden cells, develop normally.<A NAME="3IG2"></A><H4>2. Can a Melanocyte Pigment More Than One Hair?</H4><P>The observation that by the end of a given hair cycle, but when the hair is still growing, the hair bulbs of lights and darks appear to be devoid of melanocytes, and are morphologically similar to the nonpigmented bulbs of white-spotted mice which are known to lack pigment cells (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase10">Chase and Rauch, 1950</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers1">Silvers, 1956</A>), is important because it relates to the question of whether melanocytes (or their mitotic descendents) can pigment more than one hair. Thus if the disappearance of mature melanocytes from the hair follicles of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> mice is due to <I>all</I> of them being incorporated into the shaft, the melanocytes for the next hair generation would have to be derived either from some unpigmented stem cells in the epithelium, or from cells in the dermal papilla (Chase, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase3">1951</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase5">1958</A>) as is the case for feathers (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foulks1">Foulks, 1943</A>). On the other hand, it is also possible that at least some melanocytes revert to a dormant form which is indistinguishable from the epithelial cells of the follicle and are reactivated, perhaps producing mitotic descendents, when the next hair cycle is initiated (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase5">Chase, 1958</A>; <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Quevedo8">Quevedo and Chase, 1958</A>). Although according to Chase (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase5">1958</A>) the bulk of evidence supports the contention that there are stem cells at definite sites of the hair follicle which give rise to the mature and expendable melanocytes (see also discussion following <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Chase8">Chase and Mann, 1960</A>), and the situation in <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> follicles is consistent with this, there is also evidence (see <A HREF="footnotes11.shtml#17">Chapter 11, note 17</A>) which indicates strongly that melanocytes (or their mitotic descendents) can, in fact, pigment more than one hair. Perhaps both possibilities occur, i.e., while some melanocytes may be able to pigment more than one hair, a stem cell source of new cells may also operate as an insurance mechanism.<A NAME="3IG3"></A><H4>3. Influence on the Pigmentation of the Eye</H4><P>Although <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> heterozygotes and homozygotes have black eyes, the substitution of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> for <I>B</I> does result in a decrease in the amount of eye pigment, a decrease which is more pronounced in homozygotes than in heterozygotes (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Pierro1">Pierro, 1963a</A>). While this decrease is caused predominantly by a reduction in the number of melanocytes in the uveal tract, the number of pigment cells is reduced in the choroid of both lights and darks, and probably in the iris region of lights, as well. Nevertheless, the amount of pigment in the eyes of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> homozygotes and heterozygotes is somewhat greater than in <I>b</I>/<I>b</I> eyes (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Pierro1">Pierro, 1963a</A>).<A NAME="3IH"></A><H3>H.

As in the case of <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I>, <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I> mice display a reduction in the amount of pigment at the base of the hair which is more pronounced in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. However, in contrast to the situation in <I>B<SUP>lt</SUP></I> genotypes (where animals heterozygous for <I>B</I> or <I>b</I> are phenotypically identical), <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>B</I> mice are clearly different from <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>b</I> animals. In <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>B</I> animals only the extreme base of the hair is light, the remainder being just barely distinguishable from <I>B</I>/<I>B</I> dorsally, though clearly lighter ventrally. On the other hand, one-quarter to one-third of <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>b</I> dorsal hairs are near-white proximally, and the portion which is pigmented is phenotypically brown. Moreover, whereas the eyes of <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>B</I> mice are full colored, those of <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>b</I> animals appear brown. <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I> homozygotes resemble <I>B<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>b</I> heterozygotes except that the proximal, near-white portion of the hair is about twice as wide (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hunsicker2">Hunsicker, 1969</A>).<A NAME="3II"></A><H3>I.
