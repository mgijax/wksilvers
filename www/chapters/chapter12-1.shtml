These alleles occur at the so-called "microphthalmia locus" (chromosome 6) and include the following.<A NAME="12IA"></A><H3>A.

Because it is not known whether the son of this male carried the gene, or whether it was introduced by the female to whom he was mated, it is uncertain whether the mutation was induced or occurred spontaneously. Its effects have been described in some detail by Gr&#252;neberg (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg11">1952</A>) and much of the following is based on his account. <I>mi</I>, although not written with a capitol first letter, is a semidominant gene which is usually lethal when homozygous.<A NAME="12IA1"></A><H3>1. Effect When Heterozygous</H3><P>When heterozygous with the wild type allele <I>mi</I> has no noticeable effect on the intensity of the coat<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#1">1</A></SUP> but does influence the pigmentation of the eye; <I>mi</I>/+ newborns display less iris pigment than +/+.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#2">2</A></SUP> These heterozygotes also may display some white spotting (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg10">Gr&#252;neberg, 1948</A>), a manifestation which seems to depend upon their genetic background. Gr&#252;neberg found that when a <I>mi</I>/+ male in which spotting was not recognized was outcrossed to two +/+ females from a stock which carried no major spotting genes,<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#3">3</A></SUP> that most of their <I>mi</I>/+ but none of their +/+ offspring exhibited unpigmented tail tips of varying length. Additional spotting on the head and/or belly and chest occurred in <I>mi</I>/+ mice of the F<SUB>2</SUB> and subsequent generations, while some +/+ animals in these populations also displayed some low grade tail spotting. The amount of spotting on the head of the <I>mi</I>/+ mice was quite variable. It always occurred near the midline of the head and varied from a few white hairs on the forehead to fairly extensive white wedges which included a large part of the whisker area. The amount of belly spotting also varied. In some instances it was characterized by long and narrow, nearly symmetrical, streaks along the midline of the belly or chest, while in others it covered up to one-quarter of the ventrum. No dorsal spotting was ever observed. An analysis of the frequency of the spotting in these <I>mi</I>/+ mice indicated that at least three genes were involved. Some of these were minor spotting genes (see <A HREF="chapter9-2.shtml#9IIF">Chapter 9, Section II, F</A>), which are very common in mice (Gr&#252;neberg, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg3">1936b</A>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg10">1948</A>), whose effects were greatly intensified in <I>mi</I>/+ animals.<P>While <I>mi</I>/+ mice vary as to whether they display any external spotting, and as to the degree of this spotting, the internal pigmentation patterns of these heterozygotes seem to be more predictable. Thus Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol8">1971</A>) observed that pigment was absent from such a large part of their choroid (usually significantly more than half of the total area) that the pigmented areas appeared as black spots on a clear background. These were, in general, more frequent in the area of the optic nerve or along the base of the iris, but aside from this there was no obvious tendency toward a regular pattern. Deol also reported that the number of melanocytes in the harderian gland of these heterozygotes was greatly reduced and their distribution was very uneven. They were missing completely in some places, but not in any particular area. The melanocytes themselves were mostly smaller and less dendritic than in +/+ mice. Although Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">1970b</A>) did not find any abnormalities in the inner ear of these animals, about a quarter of the ears examined had no pigment in the lateral crista. The effects of <I>mi</I>/+ on pigmentation are summarized in Tables <a href="javascript:windowt121 = window.open('../tables/table12-1.shtml', 'windowt121', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt121.focus()">12-1</A> and <a href="javascript:windowt122 = window.open('../tables/table12-2.shtml', 'windowt122', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt122.focus()">12-2</A>.<A NAME="12IA2"></A><H3>2. Effect When Homozygous</H3><P>Homozygous <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> mice are completely devoid of pigment both in the fur and in the eyes and in this respect they mimic albino animals. However, unlike the albino, the unpigmented condition of these animals is undoubtedly the consequence of an absence of melanocytes. The eyes of these homozygotes are reduced in size and usually covered with cataracts (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Tost1">Tost, 1958</A>); the eyelids never open and there is a coloboma of the retina (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Muller1">Muller, 1950</A>). These anomalies result from the fact that during development the optic vesicle fails to form a proper cup and the choroid fissure remains permanently open (Muller, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Muller1">1950</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Muller2">1951</A>; see also <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fisher1">Fischer and Tost, 1959</A>; Konyukhov and Sazhina, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Konyukov1">1963</A>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Konyukov2">1966</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Konyukov3">Konyukhov <I>et al.</I>, 1965</A>). The inner ear of these homozygotes also displays abnormalities;<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#4">4</A></SUP> it also possess no pigment (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>).<P>The most severe consequence of <I>mi</I> when homozygous is that, like grey-lethal (<I>gl</I>) (see <A HREF="chapter5-1.shtml#5IB">Chapter 5, Section I, B</A>), it results in an impairment of secondary bone resorption. This osteopetrosis, although not as severe as in grey-lethal, nevertheless usually is lethal. Thus in the large majority of <I>mi</I> homozygotes the incisors never erupt and as a consequence they die on weaning. Occasionally one or two incisors are cut and if they enable the animal to eat solid food the mouse may live for some time. A microphthalmic male of Hertwig's lived to breed. Another influence of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> mentioned by Hertwig is that it causes a slight curliness of the vibrissae.<P>The reshaping of the bones in normal mice and the influence of <I>mi</I> (and <I>gl</I>) on the process has been studied in some detail by N. Bateman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Bateman4">1954</A>). Gr&#252;neberg (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg10">1948</A>) also investigated the skeleton and teeth of <I>mi</I> homozygotes and found that these animals were "an extraordinarily faithful mimic of <I>gl</I>." In both homozygotes secondary bone absorption is disturbed profoundly and the teeth of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> mice are almost exactly like those of the grey-lethal animal. Nevertheless, the dentition of <I>mi</I> homozygotes is less extremely abnormal and the failure of secondary bone absorption is less completely disturbed by <I>mi</I> than by <I>gl</I>. The differences are, however, slight.<P>Although the precise etiology of the osteopetrotic syndrome in microphthalmic mice is not known, there are no reasons to believe that it is different from the anomaly in grey-lethal animals. Consequently the reader is referred to <A HREF="chapter5-1.shtml#5IC">Chapter 5, Section C</A> for a more detailed treatment of the condition.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#5">5</A></SUP><A NAME="12IB"></A><H3>B.

Small irregular white spots, sometimes consisting of only a few hairs, often occur also on the back in the lumbar region and very occasionally normally pigmented "spots" are found (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Schaible7">Schaible, 1969</A>; see <A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#28">Chapter 10, note 28</A>). In a <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> stock derived from an outcross to C57BL, nearly all <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice had fairly large belly spots which were often broad and sometimes formed rudimentary belts (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg12">Gr&#252;neberg, 1953</A>) (see <a href="javascript:windowp3h = window.open('../figures/plate3h.shtml', 'windowp3h', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowp3h.focus()">Plate 3-H</A>). Unlike the situation in <I>mi</I>/+ animals, head dots or blazes do not occur. Nevertheless, the total amount of white is much greater in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ than in <I>mi</I>/+. Gr&#252;neberg also found that on similar genetic backgrounds, <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ and <I>mi</I>/+ mice differed greatly in the incidence of ventral spots which occurred in most of the former (37 of 41) but in few of the latter (12 of 56). The shape of the belly spots was about the same in both genotypes but those of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ were on the average larger. Although in the particular populations studied spotting on the head or face was not present in either homozygote, tail spotting was present in both with more of the tail tending to by unpigmented in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+.<P>Hairs from the pigmented regions of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice exhibit what E.S. Russell (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell1">1946</A>) has termed "pigmentation lag," i.e., there is a delay in the deposition of medullary pigment, especially distally, and the medullary granules vary greatly in size and in shape (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe5">Wolfe and Coleman, 1964</A>). According to Grobman and Charles <I>MI<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ reduces or restricts medullary pigment in a more regular manner than does dilute (<I>d</I>/<I>d</I>). They also reported that <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ animals darken slightly with age, the rate of darkening being somewhat less than in <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> mice.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#7">7</A></SUP><P>The inner ear of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice either has no pigment at all or the amount of pigment is greatly reduced in density and found only in certain areas.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#8">8</A></SUP> The inner ear itself displays severe abnormalities with every ear affected. As in the case of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> no part of the cochlea duct is normal.

In fact, some regions were pigment-free. In general, there was more pigment in the ventral than in the dorsal half of the eye (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol8">Deol, 1971</A>).<P>The harderian gland of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice is unpigmented<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#11">11</A></SUP> and the number of melanocytes in the nictitans is somewhat reduced (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert4">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>).

However, as in the case of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I>, it must be emphasized that the etiology of this unpigmented condition stems from the absence of melanocytes (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers1">Silvers, 1956</A>) and not from a biochemical block in melanin synthesis (see <a href="javascript:windowf311 = window.open('../figures/figure3-11.shtml', 'windowf311', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf311.focus()">Figure 3-11</A>a).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#13">13</A></SUP> These homozygotes also differ from albinos (<I>c</I>/<I>c</I>) in that the pigmentary layer of the retina is mostly missing (where present it is somewhat reduced, they usually are smaller than albinos, and a little pigment sometimes occurs in the inner layer of the iris (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg12">Gr&#252;neberg, 1953</A>; Deol, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">1970b</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#14">14</A></SUP> Unlike <I>mi</I> homozygotes the skeleton of these mice seems to be quite normal (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg11">Gr&#252;neberg, 1952</A>).

Etiology of Spotting</H3><P>We already have presented the evidence of Mintz (see <A HREF="chapter7-7.shtml">Chapter 7, Section VII</A>) which indicates that the complete absence of melanocytes from the coat of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> mice, and their partial absence from the coat of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ animals, is due to inviable clones of melanoblasts preprogrammed to die as a consequence of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> acting within these cells and <I>not</I> via the skin.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#16">16</A></SUP> Further evidence that <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> acts autonomously within the melanoblast is derived from the observation that +/+ host melanoblasts which invade transplants of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> neonatal skin function normally and produce intensely pigmented hairs (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers9">Silvers and E.

The eyes of these animals have a pigment ring in the iris, sometimes only slight in extent and easily overlooked, but frequently sufficiently heavy to give the eye a red rather than a pink color (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg12">Gr&#252;neberg, 1953</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes12.shtml#17">17</A></SUP> According to Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>) both the choroid and the retinal epithelium of these heterozygotes are unpigmented but an occasional retinal cell does possess some melanin granules.

Etiology of Spotting</H3><P>Like <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> <--> +/+ allophenics, <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I> <--> +/+ allophenics are either fully pigmented or display white spotting. Thus Mintz(<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz8">1971a</A>) found that, in the presence of skin mosaicism, 50% of such allophenics showed both black and white coat areas. These results indicate that, like <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>, the white coat of <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I> mice is due to the preprogrammed death of melanoblast clones (see <A HREF="chapter7-7.shtml#7VII">Chapter 7, Section VII</A>). Further evidence that this is the case stems from some experiments of Markert (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert2">1960</A>). He implanted tissues (which normally contain melanoblasts) from either +/+ or <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I> embryos into the anterior chamber of the eye of albino hosts. Whereas such implants always gave rise to many melanocytes which migrated over the inner surface of the host eye when they were derived from +/+ embryos, in no instance did melanocytes occur in or near the <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I> implants. It thus appears that for some reason the neural crest of <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I> mice does not possess cells capable of forming pigment, even in a favorable milieu.<A NAME="12ID"></A><H3>D.

Nor were any differences observed in the distance to the first cortical pigment measured from the tips of the hairs. Because medullary granules were compactly grouped and could not be counted without a large error they were not compared.

The toes and tail tip also are commonly white and adults may become grizzled, but not diluted (Hollander, personal communication). When homozygous <I>mi<SUP>ws</SUP></I> eliminates all pigment from the coat, the eyes are pink (a "mock albino").

It was noticed first in an offspring of a male whose spermatogonia had received gamma-irradiation. <I>Mi<SUP>or</SUP></I>/+ heterozygotes have a slightly diluted coat and pale, pinkish ears and tail. A white belly streak and/or white head spot also is frequently present. The eyes of these heterozygotes display reduced pigmentation at birth (resembling <I>b</I>/<I>b</I>) but appear full-colored in adults. Their fertility appears normal. <I>Mi<SUP>or</SUP></I> homozygotes have white fur. The eyes are either absent or they are so reduced in size that they <I>appear</I> absent. The eyelids never open and the incisors often fail to erupt or are poorly formed. Like <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I>, animals with this latter condition usually die after weaning unless given powdered food. Males are fully fertile, but all six females tested proved sterile. This mutant seems to resemble <I>mi</I> in some ways and <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> in others. Thus <I>Mi<SUP>or</SUP></I>/+ heterozygotes, like <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ animals, and unlike <I>mi</I>/+ mice, have a dilute pigmentation, reduced eye pigment and (usually) white spotting.
