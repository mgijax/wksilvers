Spotting Patterns of Heterozygotes</H3><P>White spotting in <I>Ph</I>/+ animals is like the spotting in piebald (<I>s</I>/<I>s</I>) and belted (<I>bt</I>/<I>bt</I>) mice in that the areas of white fur usually are sharply demarcated from the pigmented areas and only occasionally does roan or variegated spotting, i.e., the intermixture of white and pigmented hairs as is characteristic of dominant spotting (<I>W</I>/+ and <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+), occur. While <I>Ph</I>/+ mice always display at least a large belly-spot as well as extensive tail spotting and white digits, and there is frequently a large white patch in the middle of the trunk, the amount of white spotting is highly variable (Figures <a href="javascript:windowf103 = window.open('../figures/figure10-3.shtml', 'windowf103', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf103.focus()">10-3</A> and <a href="javascript:windowf104 = window.open('../figures/figure10-4.shtml', 'windowf104', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf104.focus()">10-4</A>a). Moreover, as with other spotting genes, this variability depends upon the genetic background. Thus when Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove outcrossed their patch stock to three different inbred strains (A, C57, and CBA) the F<SUB>1</SUB> <I>Ph</I>/+ mice displayed widely different amounts of dorsal white. The spotting pattern itself seems to result from "the gradual spread of a belly-spot to form a belt (sometimes with a secondary belt in the shoulder region) which then expands first posteriorly and then anteriorly."<A NAME="10IIA2"></A><H3>2. Interactions with Other Spotting Determinants</H3><P>When tests were carried out to establish the relationship between patch and some other spotting genes it was found that they interacted synergistically. Thus when <I>Ph</I>/+;<I>s</I>/+ mice were backcrossed to +/+;<I>s</I>/<I>s</I> animals the <I>Ph</I>/+;<I>s</I>/<I>s</I> offspring resembled the black-eyed white (<I>W</I>/+;<I>s</I>/<I>s</I>) of the Mouse Fancy, being either completely white, or with small pigmented patches round the eyes, ears, or on the haunches (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>). Patch likewise interacts with belted (<I>bt</I>), white (<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>), and viable dominant spotting (<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>) (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>) as well as with dominant spotting (<I>W</I>), steel (<I>Sl</I>) (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe6">Wolfe and Coleman, 1966</A>), steel-Dickie (<I>Sl<SUP>d</SUP></I>), and rump-white (<I>Rw</I>) (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>). Patch, belted (<I>Ph</I>/+;<I>bt</I>/<I>bt</I>) mice usually have pigmented heads and shoulders while the rest of the body is either completely white or has a little pigment on the haunches. Patch, white (<I>Ph</I>/+;<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+) mice resemble <I>Ph</I>/+;<I>bt</I>/<I>bt</I> animals in that pigment is confined to the head, shoulders, and forelegs, with sometimes a little on the haunches. However, unlike <I>Ph</I>/+;<I>bt</I>/<I>bt</I> animals, the pigmented areas of these mice are dilute as a consequence of the effect of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ (see <A HREF="chapter12-1.shtml#12IB1">Chapter 12, Section I, B, 1</A>). In the double heterozygote of patch and rump-white (<I>Ph</I>+/+<I>Rw</I>) the head (except for a small spot) and the shoulder region are almost fully pigmented, while the remainder of the body is white although occasional pigment patches occur (<a href="javascript:windowf104 = window.open('../figures/figure10-4.shtml', 'windowf104', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf104.focus()">Figure 10-4</A>b). The same description applies to the patch and steel-Dickie (<I>Ph</I>/+;<I>Sl<SUP>d</SUP></I>/+) double heterozygote, except that in these the pigmented fur is diluted (<a href="javascript:windowf104 = window.open('../figures/figure10-4.shtml', 'windowf104', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf104.focus()">Figure 10-4</A>c).<P>The most profound effect on pigmentation is found when patch is combined with <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> (<a href="javascript:windowf105 = window.open('../figures/figure10-5.shtml', 'windowf105', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf105.focus()">Figure 10-5</A>). <I>Ph</I>+/+<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> mice are completely unpigmented except for their head which is usually pigmented as in <a href="javascript:windowf104 = window.open('../figures/figure10-4.shtml', 'windowf104', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf104.focus()">Figure 10-4</A>d but is sometimes pigmented only on the cheeks and ears. Moreover, even the pigmented areas are diluted to a greater extent than can be accounted for solely by the influence of <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+. These animals also have less pigment in the inner ear than either heterozygote alone, a deficiency associated with more severe inner ear abnormalities (see <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>).<A NAME="10IIA3"></A><H3>3. Other Effects</H3><P>The only other anomaly found in <I>Ph</I>/+ mice is that their skull is a little wider and shorter than normal and has a large interfrontal bone (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>).<A NAME="10IIA4"></A><H3>4. Viability of Homozygotes</H3><P>Inasmuch as all patch mice tested have proved to be heterozygous and since matings between such animals produce a 2:1 rather than a 3:1 ratio of spotted to self mice, it is evident that the <I>Ph</I>/<I>Ph</I> homozygote dies sometime before birth. To determine when, Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove examined embryos from both F<SUB>2</SUB> (<I>Ph</I>/+ x <I>Ph</I>/+) and backcross (<I>Ph</I>/+ x +/+) matings at various stages in their development. They found in the F<SUB>2</SUB> matings (but <I>not</I> in the backcrosses) that some late embryos (12-17 days old) were severely disfigured by a condition that they designated as "cleft face." Nevertheless, the number of these "monsters," which obviously were <I>Ph</I>/<I>Ph</I> homozygotes, only accounted for about a third of their expected number. Clearly, about two-thirds of the <I>Ph</I>/<I>Ph</I> embryos had died before they reached this stage.<P>Further studies revealed that the primary abnormality of <I>Ph</I> homozygotes is an increase in their water content (hydrops) which seems to develop between the 8- and 9-day stage.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#33">33</A></SUP> Abnormal accumulations of liquid are observed first flanking the notochord posteriorly and later anteriorly. To a varying extent, excess fluid also occurs in the circulation, pericardium, under the epidermis, and within the tissues. The more severely affected embryos die around the tenth day but about one-third survive longer. These subsequently develop a subepidermal bleb in the middle of the face which interferes mechanically with the formative movements of the nose and palate and hence is responsible for the "cleft-face."<P>It appears obvious from the more extreme manifestations of the <I>Ph</I> homozygous condition that the total water content of the embryo is greatly increased and that this excess fluid must be of external origin. Whether it enters via the allantois, or whether it is derived from the amniotic cavity of from the extraembryonic coelom is, however, not known.<A NAME="10IIA5"></A><H3>5. Pigmentation of Homozygotes</H3><P>The pigmentation of <I>Ph</I> homozygotes has recently been investigated by Mayer (unpublished) who transplanted skin from various regions of two 14-day-old <I>Ph</I>/<I>Ph</I> embryos, identified by "cleft-face," to the testes of compatible hosts. He found that whereas skin from the vibrissae region always produced pigmented hairs, and skin from the shoulder and hip regions gave rise to either pigmented, unpigmented, or a mixture of pigmented and unpigmented hairs, all grafts from the flank region were unpigmented. It thus appears that, unlike splotch (<I>Sp</I>) homozygotes (see <A HREF="chapter11-3.shtml#11IIIA2">Chapter 11, Section III, A, 2</A>), <I>Ph</I>/<I>Ph</I> animals have some viable melanoblast clones. They also possess pigmented eyes.<A NAME="10IIA6"></A><H3>6. Influence on Erythropoiesis and Gametogenesis</H3><P>Because the <I>Ph</I>-locus is so closely linked to the <I>W</I>-locus, Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove determined whether <I>Ph</I> influenced erythropoiesis or germ cell development. They found that 13- to 14-day-old <I>Ph</I>/+ heterozygotes were not anemic (see also <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>) and that <I>Ph</I> homozygotes appeared to have the normal numbers of primordial germ cells at 10 days gestation.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#34">34</A></SUP> Whether these homozygotes are, or would be, anemic was not possible to determine but the did find that <I>Ph</I>+/+<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> animals suffered from a slightly more severe macrocytic anemia than that associated with <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> (<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+) alone. Thus while these data do not provide a strong case for the existence of a specific (allelic) interaction between the <I>Ph</I> and <I>W</I> loci, neither do they rule it out (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>).<A NAME="10IIB"></A><H3>B.

It has been analyzed by Searle and Truslove (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">1970</A>) and the following is based on their observations.<A NAME="10IIC1"></A><H3>1. Spotting Patterns of Heterozygotes</H3><P>Mice heterozygous for rump-white (<I>Rw</I>/+) usually "have white tails, apart from frequent distal pigmentation,<SUP><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#36">36</A></SUP> white hind legs and a variable area of depigmentation in the sacral and lumbar regions. This tends to be rather more extensive ventrally than dorsally. Occasionally there are islands of pigmented hair surrounded by white. Digits of forefeet also tend to be white." Three typical <I>Rw</I>/+ mice are shown in <a href="javascript:windowf107 = window.open('../figures/figure10-7.shtml', 'windowf107', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf107.focus()">Figure 10-7</A> (see also <a href="javascript:windowf108 = window.open('../figures/figure10-8.shtml', 'windowf108', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf108.focus()">Figure10-8a</A>).<P>As in <I>Ph</I>/+ mice, the pigmented areas of the coat of <I>Rw</I>/+ animals show no signs of dilution. In fact, rump-white shows a definite phenotypic resemblance to patch, except that the main area which is unpigmented is in the lumbosacral instead of the thoracolumbar region. The average amount of tail pigmentation also is greater in patch.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#37">37</A></SUP><A NAME="10IIC2"></A><H3>2. Homozygotes</H3><P>Rump-white like patch behaves like a fully penetrant dominant mutation which is lethal when homozygous. Although the exact cause of death is not known, dissections of pregnant females from <I>Rw</I>/+ x <I>Rw</I>/+ matings revealed an excess of dead embryos in mid-pregnancy, at about the frequency expected if the comprised the <I>Rw</I>/<I>Rw</I> class (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>).<A NAME="10IIC3"></A><H3>3.

Moreover, there is always a large mid-dorsal head spot and very little pigmentation ventrally. The ears are always pigmented but, as in <I>Ph</I> +/+ <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> animals, there is less pigment in the inner ear (and more inner ear abnormalities) than in either <I>Rw</I>/+ or <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+ mice (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>).<P>In general, the interaction of <I>Rw</I> with other spotting genes results in the posterior part of the coat being affected more than the anterior (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>). Thus rump-white, piebald (<I>Rw</I>/+;<I>s</I>/<I>s</I>) mice have pigmented hairs on their head and shoulders, but little elsewhere. With lethal spotting (<I>ls</I>), <I>Rw</I> displays a greater reduction of pigmentation than with <I>s</I>, so that only one or a very few colored patches, mainly dorsal and anterior to the sacrocaudal region, remain (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1070</A>). Typical examples of the spotting patterns displayed by rump-white, belted (<I>Rw</I>/+;<I>bt</I>/<I>bt</I>), rump-white, steel-Dickie (<I>Rw</I>/+;<I>Sl<SUP>d</SUP></I>/+), and rump-white, splotch (<I>Rw</I>/+;<I>Sp</I>/+) mice are shown in <a href="javascript:windowf108 = window.open('../figures/figure10-8.shtml', 'windowf108', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf108.focus()">Figure 10-8</A>c, d and e. With <I>bt</I>, as with <I>s</I>, the area without pigmentation seems less than Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">1960</A>) reported for <I>Ph</I>. Furthermore, a similar situation seems to prevail when <I>Rw</I>/+;<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice are compared with <I>Ph</I>/+;<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ animals; although both of these genotypes possess pigmented heads, shoulders, and forelegs, only in the former is there considerable pigment in the thoracic region.<A NAME="10IIC4"></A><H3>4. Influence on Erythropoiesis</H3><P>Because of the close linkage between <I>Rw</I> and <I>W</I> the blood picture of <I>Rw</I>/+ mice and of <I>Rw</I> +/+ <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> animals has also received attention. As in the case of <I>Ph</I>/+, <I>Rw</I>/+ mice have a normal blood picture while the double heterozygote of <I>Rw</I> and <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> is slightly more affected than <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+ alone both with respect to the number of erythrocytes, and their mean corpuscular volume (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>).<A NAME="10IID"></A><H3>D. Etiology of White Spotting in <I>Rw</I>/+ and <I>Ph</I>/+ Mice</H3><P>Although, as in the above testifies, there are obvious differences in the pigmentation patterns of <I>Rw</I>/+ and <I>Ph</I>/+ mice, the most interesting difference was found when thin slices of 1- to 3-day-old skin from various pigmented and nonpigmented regions of these genotypes were cleared, prepared for microscopic examination, and compared. Whereas it was found that in 1-day-old <I>Rw</I>/+ mice dendritic melanocytes were scattered throughout the epidermis, even in areas which were devoid of pigmented hair bulbs, in <I>Ph</I>/+ animals very few pigmented epidermal melanocytes were seen either in regions of pigmented or of white hair. Thus, in the pigmented rump region of <I>Ph</I>/+ mice there were decidedly fewer melanocytes in the epidermis than were found in normal littermates or in the white rump area of <I>Rw</I>/+ mice (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>).<P>The presence of many extrafollicular melanocytes in the white rump region of <I>Rw</I>/+ infant mice indicates that the absence of hair pigment is not due to a failure of melanoblasts to migrate into or survive in this region. Moreover, as pointed out by Searle and Truslove, this is reinforced by the fact that the white spotting of the scrotum and of the tail of these mice includes not only the hairs, i.e., the skin through which these hairs emerge is pigmented (see <a href="javascript:windowf107 = window.open('../figures/figure10-7.shtml', 'windowf107', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf107.focus()">Figure 10-7</A>). While these observations could be taken as evidence that the white spotting of <I>Rw</I>, unlike that of <I>Ph</I>, is due to some genetic defect which prevents melanoblasts from either entering or maturing in the hairs of the affected region, as has been claimed for belted (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mayer10">Mayer and Maltby, 1964</A>) (<A HREF="chapter9-4.shtml#9IVB">Chapter 9, Section IV, B</A>), there is an alternative explanation. If one assumes that the melanocyte population in the white rump area of <I>Rw</I>/+ mice represents a <I>secondary</I> population which migrated in after the original population failed to survive because it originated from a defective clone(s) (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz5">Mintz, 1969a</A>), the unpigmented hairs in this region could result from the fact that this "new" population entered the region too late to become incorporated into the developing hair bulbs. Similarly, the white spotting in <I>Ph</I>/+ mice also could be due to the preprogrammed death of specific clones of melanoblasts but at a time too late for them to be replaced by viable cells from adjacent regions. In accord with this interpretation is the observation that whereas in <I>Ph</I>/+ mice there is a sharp demarcation line between the areas of pigmented and nonpigmented hair bulbs (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg22">Gr&#252;neberg and Truslove, 1960</A>), in <I>Rw</I>/+ animals unpigmented hair bulbs are sometimes surrounded by pigmented ones and vice versa (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle10">Searle and Truslove, 1970</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#38">38</A></SUP><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="chapter10-1.shtml">Previous</A></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="footnotes10.shtml">Next</A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><PRE></PRE></body></html>
