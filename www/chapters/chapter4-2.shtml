The interesting feature of this allele, which is recessive to <I>p</I>, is its pleiotropic effects. In addition to its influence on pigmentation, which is the same as <I>p</I>, this allele has a number of other effects some of which seem unrelated. <I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I> mice not only weigh less at birth than their normal littermates but grow poorly, partly because their incisors wear abnormally and they have difficulty in chewing, and are noticeably smaller as adults (Hollander et. al, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander7">1960a</A>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander8">1960b</A>). The locomotion of these mice is also somewhat uncoordinated and at times almost waltzing. Moreover, males are almost completely sterile as a consequence of both a poor mating response and a very high incidence of abnormal sperm. The sperm defect has been traced to an abnormality of the acrosome cap which occurs at the spermatid stage resulting in sperm heads which are very variable in shape and structure, although sperm motility is not lost. The Golgi body seems implicated in the acrosome defect. Since <I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I>/<I>p</I> heterozygotes have normal sperm it is apparent that sperm morphology depends on the paternal genotype (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Searle4">Searle, 1968a</A>). <I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I> females, although more fertile than males, likewise often fail to breed and, when fertile, produce few litters and are poor mothers (Hollander <I>et al.</I>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander7">1960a</A>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander8">1960b</A>). <I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>s</SUP></I> mice also display extensive lesions of the pars nervosa and median eminence. The pituitary gland is reduced in size [in fact, D. Hunt and D.

Moreover she adds "<I>p<SUP>x</SUP></I> and <I>p<SUP>d</SUP></I> fall into a darker, less <I>p</I>-looking category than <I>p<SUP>bs</SUP></I> and <I>p<SUP>dn</SUP></I> and this effect is phenotypically dominant" (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Phillips19">R.J.S.

Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>). When heterozygous with <I>p</I>, each of these mutations produces a coat in which wild-type areas and areas of typical pink-eyed dilute phenotype are freely intermingled (L. Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>). While, on the average, about 50% of the coat expresses the wild-type coloration and 50% that of <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> mice, there may be a great deal of variation among animals. Inasmuch as at least 50% of the more than 1000 offspring produced from mating <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I><I>p</I> animals with <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> mice were mottled, the remainder being pink-eyed dilute (L. Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>), it appears that this condition cannot be attributed to a somatically, highly mutable "wild-type" allele.<SUP>15</SUP> It is therefore apparent that <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I> occurs in all cells but for some unknown reason produces intense pigment in some and typical pink-eyed dilute pigment in others. Although there is no evidence that <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I> is the result of a position effect, small rearrangements or other types of very closely linked variable suppressors of <I>P</I> have not been completely ruled out (L. Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>).<P>There is some similarity between the effect of the <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I> alleles and mottled agouti (<I>a<SUP>m</SUP></I>), an allele at the <I>a</I>-locus (see <A HREF="chapter2-1.shtml#2IA12">Chapter 2, Section I, A, 12</A>) which often produces agouti and nonagouti patches of fur freely intermingled at their edges (L. Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>). This similarity is especially striking since <I>a<SUP>m</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> animals also produce about 50% mottled progeny when mated to <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> mice (L. Russell, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell29">1964</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell30">1965</A>). Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that although the mottling of <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I>/<I>p</I> and <I>a<SUP>m</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> may seem similar they actually are quite different. This stems from the fact that whereas the <I>a</I>-locus acts via the hair bulb environment (see <A HREF="chapter2-1.shtml#2IE">Chapter 2, Section I, E</A> and <A HREF="chapter7-4.shtml">Chapter 7, Section IV</A>), the <I>p</I>-locus acts autonomously within the melanocyte (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers4">Silvers, 1958b</A>).<A NAME="4IIC9"></A><H4>9. <I>p</I>-Unstable (<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>)</H4><!-- Genes and Alleles Link --><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER>For the <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> allele:</TD></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgiid_url.html'-->MGI:1856123" target="_blank"><I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> Allele (MGI)</A></TD><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgiid_url.html'-->MGI:97454" target="_blank">Gene (MGI)</A></TD><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgiall_url.html'-->MGI:97454" target="_blank">All Alleles (MGI)</A></TD></TR></TABLE><P><I>p</I>-unstable (<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>) [formerly <I>p'</I> or <I>p<SUP>m</SUP></I> (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe2">Wolfe, 1963</A>)] is the final allele at the <I>p</I>-locus. It also produces a phenotype consisting of areas of dilute and intense pigmentation. However, unlike <I>p<SUP>m1</SUP></I> and <I>p<SUP>m2</SUP></I>, this bicolored pattern seems to be due to a spontaneous somatic reversion to wild type at a relatively high frequency at all stages of development. Data from experimental matings have shown that the frequency of somatic reversion of <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> to + occurs more often in <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> progeny of heterozygous parents, <I>p</I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> or +/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> mated <I>inter se</I>, than from homozygous <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> parents mated <I>inter se</I> (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Melvold1">Melvold, 1971</A>). It is also higher in <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> progeny from somatically mosaic parents, even when there is no evidence for germinal mosaicism (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Melvold1">Melvold, 1971</A>). The proportion of the coat affected appears to follow a bimodal distribution, i.e., it is usually either very small or quite large with few intermediate cases (the majority of mosaic animals fall into the former category).<SUP>16</SUP> Melvold has calculated that the spontaneous somatic reversion rates (at day 10 of embryonic life) in <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> progeny from matings in which the parents are mosaic or heterozygous, are generally two to three times that of <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> progeny from solid colored (nonmottled) <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> <I>inter se</I> matings.<SUP>17</SUP> While the exact basis for the expression of this allele is not known, Melvold suggests "that certain heterozygous combinations allow the formation, by recombination, of new alleles of varying stability and that the choice of mosaic mice for experimental matings may, in fact, result in selection for unstable alleles."<SUP>18</SUP><P>When <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> mice are bicolored (see <a href="javascript:windowf75 = window.open('../figures/figure7-5.shtml', 'windowf75', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf75.focus()">Figure 7-5</A>), their phenotypes correspond to those of allophenic mice produced from merging embryos known to bear different alleles for coat-color determinants which act via the melanocyte (Mintz, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz4">1967</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz5">1969a</A>). Indeed, the similarities between the pigment pattern of <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> and allophenic mice strongly supports Mintz's contention that all of the melanocytes of the adult coat are <I>clonally</I> derived from a finite number of primordial melanoblasts originating along the mid-dorsum of the embryo (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz4">Mintz, 1967</A> (see <A HREF="chapter7-6.shtml">Chapter 7, Section VI</A>).<SUP>19</SUP><A NAME="4IID"></A><H3>D. Influence of Pink-Eyed Dilution on Pigment Granules</H3><P>The influence that substituting <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> for +/+ has on the attributes of the pigment granules, and their distribution in the hair of different genotypes, has been carefully examined by E.S. Russell (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell1">1946</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell2">1948</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell3">1949a</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell4">1949b</A>). The major effect of this substitution is to alter the size of the pigment granules of all nonagouti genotypes, changing them to a very characteristic irregular shred shape, with flocculent clumping (<a href="javascript:windowf46 = window.open('../figures/figure4-6.shtml', 'windowf46', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf46.focus()">Figure 4-6</A>). Tiny flecks of pigment are also present, and the edges of the granules never appear as clear or as sharp as in +/+ mice (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell4">E. Russell, 1949b</A>). As granule size is one of the key pigmentation characteristics affecting shape and color intensity, it is possible that the unique shape of <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> granules results from their small size (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell4">E. Russell, 1949b</A>). The color quality of the pigment itself is not altered, but the degree of pigmentation in both nonagoutis and yellows is decreased as a consequence of fewer cortical granules and an increase in pigmentation lag. Although <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>p</I>/<I>p</I> granules are unique, their attributes may nevertheless be affected, albeit in a minor way, by certain other genic substitutions. Thus, pink-eyed dilute brown (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>;<I>p</I>/<I>p</I>) granules are, on the average, shorter and more rounded that those of pink-eyed dilute black (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I>;<I>p</I>/<I>p</I>) mice (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell4">E. Russell, 1949b</A>).<A NAME="4IIE"></A><H3>E. Ultrastructural Observations and Possible Gene Action</H3><P>The influence that pink-eye dilution has on the ultrastructure of the nonagouti melanin granule has received attention from Moyer(<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer1">1961</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer2">1963</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">1966</A>), Rittenhouse (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Rittenhouse2">1968b</A>), and Hearing <I>et al.</I> (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hearing1">1973</A>). Unfortunately there is no unanimity in their observations. Moyer observed that in the very early development of the +/+ melanosome thin single fibers aggregate to form compound fibers which cross-link and become oriented parallel to each other, however, in <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> mice the fibers do not become arranged in the same orderly parallel fashion and there is much less cross-linking between them (<a href="javascript:windowf47 = window.open('../figures/figure4-7.shtml', 'windowf47', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf47.focus()">Figure 4-7</A>). As a consequence the mature granule never achieves the size of a "normal" granule and its shape is altered. Although this lack of orientation of the fiber matrix in <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> mice makes it difficult to assess the granularity of the melanin deposited, Moyer did find occasional granules in which at least a portion of the matrix was fairly well oriented. A study of the melanin in these areas indicated that the <I>p</I>-locus did not affect the granularity of the melanin nor, as might be expected, was the second-order periodicity altered. Thus according to Moyer, the <I>p</I>-locus appears someone to be involved with the early structure of the melanosome matrix possibly by controlling the protein which provides cross-linkages. This cross-linkage is basic to the structure of the final granule and could influence tyrosinase activity in numerous ways (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe6">Wolfe and Coleman, 1966</A>).<P>In contrast to these observations, however, are those of Rittenhouse (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Rittenhouse2">1968b</A>). She reported little difference between the structure of <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> and +/+ granules. Indeed, according to her observations the only striking characteristic of both pink-eyed black and pink-eyed brown melanocyte granules is that, in contrast to the wild-type (nonagouti), a high proportion of them are lightly melanized or unmelanized. <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> granules also are noticeably smaller than +/+ granules, apparently because they fail to enlarge after melanization is initiated. Rittenhouse's comparison of the granules of pink-eyed black and pink-eyed brown melanocytes with each other, and with intense black and brown granules, is particularly interesting because they indicate that <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> can shift the disorderly internal framework she found characteristic of <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>;<I>P</I>/<I>P</I> granules &#151; an internal framework resembling a tangled ball of strands (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Rittenhouse1">Rittenhouse, 1968a</A>) &#151; toward the much more organized pattern of longitudinal strands and membranes characteristic of <I>B</I>/<I>B</I> granules (see <A HREF="chapter3-1.shtml#3IF">Chapter 3, Sections I, F</A> and <A HREF="chapter3-2.shtml#3IIG">II, G</A>).<P>While one might attribute the different observations of Moyer and Rittenhouse to the fact that the latter examined only the granules of the hair bulb melanocytes whereas the former paid particular attention to those of the retina, this does not seem to be completely responsible for the discord. Thus, more recently Hearing and his colleagues have examined pigment granules from retinal epithelial cells and from choroidal melanocytes of <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> mice and report no decisive differences. Indeed, their observations are similar to those of Rittenhouse since they found the only significant difference between <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> and +/+ granules was that the former were much less melanized (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hearing1">Hearing <I>et al.</I>, 1973</A>).<P>The elegant study of Sidman and Pearlstein (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sidman1">1965</A>) deserves special consideration not only because it too includes some ultrastructural observations on pink-eyed granules, but because it focuses attention on another possible mode of action of <I>p</I>-series alleles. These investigators cultured eye tissue from postnatal <I>p</I>/<I>p</I>, <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p</I>, and <I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I>/<I>p<SUP>un</SUP></I> mice <I>in vitro</I> and observed that when tyrosine was present in the culture medium the amount of pigment was greatly increased over that found <I>in vivo</I>. This increase in melanin occurred both in melanocytes and pigment epithelial cells and was unrelated to the structure of the granule. Thus, in agreement with Moyer's observations, Sidman and Pearlstein also found numerous melanosomes in their pink-eyed cultures with internal membranes in disarray. Indeed, the fact that these abnormal melanosomes appeared to make pigment as effectively <I>in vitro</I> as normal melanosomes while maintaining their abnormal morphology indicates that, contrary to the suggestion of Moyer (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer2">1963</A>), their structure is not responsible for the reduced amount of pigment they normally display.<P>It therefore appears that the effect of the <I>p</I>-series of alleles on pigment formation may result from a failure to use an existing melanin-synthesizing enzyme system at a rate adequate to achieve normal pigmentation (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sidman1">Sidman and Pearlstein, 1965</A>). This possibility is in accord with other biochemical studies (Foster, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster3">1963</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster4">1965</A>; Coleman, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman3">1963</A>) and, if confirmed, might help explain some of the pleiotropic effects of <I>p</I>-locus alleles. If for some reason <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> melanocytes cannot use tyrosine, or a further metabolite in the melanin pathway, at a normal rate because of some intracellular competition which favors some alternate use of available substrate, this diversion of tyrosine could be involved in producing some of the other effects attributed to the locus (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sidman1">Sidman and Pearlstein, 1965</A>). On the other hand, at least some of the pleiotropic effects attributed to this locus could very well be a consequence of chromosomal deletions involving adjacent loci concerned with other functions (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Melvold3">Melvold, 1974</A>). Indeed, this possibility is especially attractive since those "<I>p</I> alleles" with the most severe effects were all radiation induced.<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="chapter4-1.shtml">Previous</A></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="chapter4-3.shtml">Next</A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><PRE></PRE></body></html>
