Structure of the Locus (Simple vs Complex)</H3><P>As the above description of the phenotype(s) associated with each agouti locus allele testifies, the locus is a complicated one (see <a href="javascript:windowt22 = window.open('../tables/table2-2.shtml', 'windowt22', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt22.focus()">Table 2-2</A>). In general, as one proceeds from top dominance (<I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>) to bottom recessive (<I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>) there is an increase in the amount of eumelanin, indicating that the synthesis of less black is dominant to the production of more. This tendency to produce yellow pigment appears also to be greater in ventral than in dorsal hair follicles and is even greater in the hairs of the pinna. However, there are some important exceptions to these generalizations and these have convinced some investigators that the agouti locus is composed of several very closely linked "mini-loci", each of which controls the proportion of yellow and black pigment for different parts of the body, e.g., dorsum, ventrum, ears, etc. (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Pincus1">Pincus, 1929</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Keeler1">Keeler, 1931</A>; Wallace, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace2">1954</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace3">1962</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace4">1965</A>). Indeed, according to Wallace (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace4">1965</A>), the situation to be envisaged is similar to the pseudoallelic system proposed by Fisher to account for the Rh blood group antigens in man (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Race1">Race and Sanger, 1962</A>).<P>Let us consider the evidence supporting this complex locus theory. Probably the best evidence is that inasmuch as <I>a<SUP>x</SUP></I> and <I>A<SUP>s</SUP></I> have already been demonstrated to be closely linked to <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>, and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> and <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>, respectively, and there is some evidence that <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I> is pseudoallelic to <I>a</I> just as it is to <I>a<SUP>x</SUP></I> (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell37">L. Russell <I>et al.</I>, 1963</A>), there is precedence for an even more extensive series of closely linked determinants. Further support for a complex locus stems from the observation that as one proceeds down the agouti locus series, the change from black to yellow occurs in one place in the series for one part of the pelage and in another for a different area. Thus phaeomelanin disappears from the mid-dorsum at compound <I>A<SUP>i</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> (but not <I>A<SUP>i</SUP></I>/<I>A<SUP>i</SUP></I>), from the lateral dorsum at <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> and its lower compounds, from the ventrum at <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> and its lower compounds, and from the pinna and genital ridge at <I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>. Although these changes may merely reflect the fact that certain regions of the body, e.g. the ventrum and pinna, present a milieu more favorable for the synthesis of phaeomelanin, they are also compatible with the notion that several very closely linked loci are involved, one controlling the proportion of yellow-black pigment for one part of the body, and one for another region.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#12">12</A></SUP> For example, as pointed out by Wallace (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace4">1965</A>), if one "mini-locus," <I>D</I>, controlled dorsal banding, and another, <I>V</I>, controlled ventral banding, with dominance of the yellow component in each case, the genotypes <I>A</I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>a</I>, which have the same phenotype, light-bellied agouti, would become <I>Dv</I>/<I>d V</I> and <I>DV</I>/<I>dv</I>, respectively. Such an interpretation would explain the observation that the series <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>:<I>A</I>:<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> represents a grading yellow to black dorsally but not ventrally.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#13">13</A></SUP><P>Proponents of the complex locus hypothesis argue that it is difficult to envisage on the simple locus theory how two alleles, <I>A<SUP>vy</SUP></I> and <I>a<SUP>m</SUP></I> (and perhaps <I>A<SUP>iy</SUP></I> should also be included), which are relatively high and low in the dominance hierarchy, produce mottling, whereas it does not appear in any of the intermediate compounds (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace4">Wallace, 1965</A>). According to the multiple locus theory, mottling is attributed to yet another closely linked locus&#151;or possibly two further loci (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace4">Wallace, 1965</A>).<P>Mutations to light (yellow) belly are much more frequent than mutations to other agouti locus genotypes both in the laboratory (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Isherwood1">Isherwood <I>et al.</I> 1960</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Dickie12">Dickie, 1969a</A>)<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#14">14</A></SUP> and in the wild (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace2">Wallace, 1954</A>) and the advocates of the pseudoallelism theory believe that this too is consonant with their position.

For example, Wallace (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace2">1954</A>) reported that a nonagouti (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>) mouse was produced from an <I>A</I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> female x <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> male mating. While it is conceivable that a mutation to <I>a</I> occurred from <I>A</I> or <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>, it is also possible that the unexpected phenotype resulted from a crossover. If yellow belly is designated as <I>W</I>, a gene closely linked to <I>a</I>, and nonyellow belly as <I>w</I>, its recessive allele, then Wallace's mating can be designated <I>Aw</I>/<I>aW</I> female x <I>aw</I>/<I>aw</I> male and a simple crossover could yield an <I>aw</I> ovum (see <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Keeler1">Keeler, 1931</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg14">Gr&#252;neberg, 1966a</A>).<P>Finally, the advocates for the complex locus hypothesis believe that evolutionary considerations support their contention. They find it difficult to understand why if one locus is involved, two different genotypes, <I>A</I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151;, should have as a result of selection the same phenotype (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace2">Wallace, 1954</A>).<P>In spite of all the evidence supporting the complex locus theory, there are some observations which argue against it. On numerous occasions <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> matings have produced <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151; offspring (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Little12">Little and Hummel, 1947</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Bhat1">Bhat, 1949</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hoecker1">Hoecker, 1950</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Dickie12">Dickie, 1969a</A>) (see <A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#13">note 13</A>). While according to the simple locus concept this merely requires a single mutation, albeit one which "skips a step," i.e., <I>a</I> &#151;> <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> (skipping <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>), the complex locus interpretation requires two simultaneous mutations, one from <I>a</I> &#151;> <I>A</I> and the other from <I>w</I> &#151;> <I>W</I>. Nevertheless, two such simultaneous mutations in a single animal have been documented (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Dickie12">Dickie, 1969a</A>)<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#15">15</A></SUP> and one could conceive that if two loci are involved, they are so closely associated that a mutating agent affecting one would frequently affect the other (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wallace2">Wallace, 1954</A>). Still more difficult to reconcile with the two locus hypothesis is R.J.S. Phillips' (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Phillips9">1966a</A>) observation that <I>A<SUP>s</SUP></I> affects the belly of <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> mice differently than it does the ventrum of <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> animals; the belly of <I>A<SUP>s</SUP>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> homozygotes is a dark agouti whereas the ventrum of <I>A<SUP>s</SUP>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> homozygotes is nonagouti. According to the complex locus interpretation, this would indicate that the yellow belly of <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> and <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> mice are not equivalent and would necessitate a locus for banding and a locus for yellow belly rather than one for dorsal and one for ventral banding (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Phillips9">R.J.S. Phillips, 1966a</A>).<P>Any hypothesis involving two loci would also be expected to produce some phenotypes with the ventrum darker than the dorsum or with plain hair on the dorsum and banded hair on the belly, and these have never been observed. Indeed, the relationship of back, belly, and ears is such that if the ears are dark, so is the belly and if the ventrum is dark, so is the dorsum (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Phillips9">R.J.S. Phillips, 1966a</A>).<P>Finally it should be noted that the mutation to extreme nonagouti first occurred in an agouti stock (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander6">Hollander and Gowen, 1956</A>) which, according to the complex locus theory, would require at least three distinct mutations: one affecting the dorsum, one affecting the ventrum, and one affecting the ears!<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#16">16</A></SUP><P>Clearly, the structure of the agouti locus remains to be resolved but it probably will not be until the specific biochemical processes involved in producing the various agouti locus phenotypes are determined.<A NAME="2IC"></A><H3>C. Eumelanin and Phaeomelanin: Structure, Ultrastructure, and Biosynthesis</H3><P>Regardless of the chromosomal structure of the agouti locus it is apparent that it determines whether eumelanin, phaeomelanin, or both of these pigments are synthesized in the melanocytes of the hair bulb. Moreover, it should be emphasized that these two kinds of pigments are appreciably different from each other when examined under the electron (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">Moyer, 1966</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sakurai1">Sakurai <I>et al.</I>, 1975</A>) or conventional microscope (E.

When viewed under the latter, yellow granules from either <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151; or <I>A</I>/&#151; hairs are uniformly round and of approximately the same intensity and size, whereas black granules are much more variable in their characteristics (see <a href="javascript:windowf46 = window.open('../figures/figure4-6.shtml', 'windowf46', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf46.focus()">Figure 4-6</A>) with three different grades of color, four recognizably different shapes, and a wide variation in size (see <a href="javascript:windowt23 = window.open('../tables/table2-3.shtml', 'windowt23', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt23.focus()">Table 2-3</A>) (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell3">E. Russell, 1949a</A>). The total pigment volume in black hairs also is about five times higher than in yellow hairs (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell2">E. Russell, 1948</A>) and whereas eumelanin is insoluble in almost all solvents and resistant to chemical treatment, phaeomelanin is soluble in dilute alkali (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Jimbow1">Jimbow <I>et al.</I>, 1976</A>; see also <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Ikejima1">Ikejima and Takeuchi, 1978</A>).<P>When examined under the electron microscope, yellow and black granules again display striking differences which suggest that the ontogeny of yellow granules is quite distinct from granules producing eumelanin (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">Moyer, 1966</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sakurai1">Sakurai <I>et al.</I>, 1975</A>). One characteristic feature of the ultrastructure of yellow granules is that they do not possess any organized matrix (<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('../figures/figure2-2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2-2</A>) so that although pigment is laid down in discrete areas, it is deposited randomly on a tangled mat of exceedingly fine fibers which are almost translucent to the electron beam (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">Moyer, 1966</A>). According to Moyer (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Moyer3">1966</A>), "there is no ordered aggregation of fibers nor is there any organized cross-linking. As the phaeomelanin accumulates, the areas of deposition spread and fuse until finally the granule assumes a very dense homogeneous appearance. Very occasionally the areas of melanin deposition in the granules are found in linear arrays reminiscent of intermediate stages in the ontogeny of eumelanin granules [see <A HREF="chapter3-1.shtml#3IE">Chapter 3; section I, E and F</A>], but even then no organized matrix is visible."<P>Of particular relevance is the ultrastructural study by Sakurai and his associates (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sakurai1">1975</A>) on <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> melanocytes. These investigators observed that hair follicle melanocytes in transition from black to yellow possess <I>both</I> eumelanosomes and phaeomelanosomes (<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('../figures/figure2-3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2-3</A>). This not only constitutes the best evidence to date that the shift from eumelanin to phaeomelanin synthesis, or vice versa, occurs within a single cell, but it indicates that one population of cells is responsible for all the patterns of pigmentation associated with the <I>a</I> locus (see also <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith1">Galbraith, 1964</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Geschwind1">Geschwind <I>et al.</I>, 1972</A>).<P>In regard to the biosynthesis of these two melanins (<a href="javascript:windowf24 = window.open('../figures/figure2-4.shtml', 'windowf24', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf24.focus()">Figure 2-4</A>), the prevailing contention has been that eumelanin is a protein conjugate formed by the coupling of a quinoid polymer, indole-5,6-quinone, with protein to form eumelanin granules. Tyrosine is the natural precursor of eumelanin, and a single, copper-containing, enzyme complex, tyrosinase, is involved in the first two steps of the conversion of this colorless amino acid to melanin: step one, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and step two, the oxidation of dopa to dopaquinone. According to this scheme, eumelanin is a homopolymer of indole-5,6-quinone units, formed from intramolecular rearrangements of oxidative products of dopaquinone, linked through a single bond type (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick3">Fitzpatrick and Lerner, 1954</A>; <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Lerner1">Lerner, 1955</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick4">Fitzpatrick <I>et al.</I>, 1958</A>; <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Lerner2">Lerner and Case, 1959</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick2">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster4">Foster, 1965</A>). However, there is also some evidence that eumelanin may actually be a heteropolymer, or a random polymer derived from the linkage of many different indoles, including 5,6-dihydroxyindole (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Nicolaus1">Nicolaus and Piatelli, 1965</A>), or that it is a highly irregular, three-dimensional polymer composed of several types of monomers joined by different covalent bonds (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Bolois1">Blois <I>et al.</I>, 1964</A>; <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Jimbow1">Jimbow <I>et al.</I>, 1976</A>).<P>Although at one time there was evidence to suggest that phaeomelanin might be derived from tryptophan, i.e., that an ortho-aminophenol derived from tryptophan might be oxidized by dopaquinone to produce a yellow pigment under the influence of a genetically controlled switch mechanism (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick4">Fitzpatrick <I>et al.</I>, 1958</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Fitzpatrick2">Fitzpatrick and Kukita, 1959</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster4">Foster, 1965</A>), yellow pigment, too, is almost certainly a product of tyrosine metabolism.<P>Support for the notion that tryptophan might be involved in phaeomelanin synthesis stemmed primarily from the efforts of Foster (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster1">1951</A>) who found that oxygen uptake in pulverized yellow skin was stimulated considerably when it was incubated with tryptophan (see also <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Nachmias1">Nachmias, 1959</A>). Moreover, the production of a yellow pigment accompanied this reaction. While it was known that incubating yellow skin in tyrosine produced a black pigment, it was believed that yellow skin possessed an inhibitor of tyrosinase since when <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> skin was mixed with <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> skin the latter appeared to inhibit the tyrosinase activity normally present in the <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> tissue (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster1">Foster, 1951</A>). Nevertheless, all attempts to demonstrate directly the formation of yellow pigment from tryptophan have failed. Thus while Markert (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert1">1955</A>) and Coleman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>) were unable to show that <SUP>14</SUP>C-labeled tryptophan was incorporated into melanin, these investigators found that <SUP>14</SUP>C-labeled tyrosine was included. The study by Coleman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>) is particularly pertinent since he employed mice of various genotypes. He observed that if labeled tryptophan was injected into yellow, black, or brown baby mice it was not incorporated into any of these pigments, whereas labeled tyrosine occurred in all of them, albeit at a somewhat reduced rate in yellow, as compared with black and brown skin. Coleman observed also that skin slices prepared from yellow animals likewise failed to incorporate [<SUP>14</SUP>C]tryptophan, but did incorporate [<SUP>14</SUP>C]tyrosine at about one-third the normal rate observed for nonagouti skin (see <a href="javascript:windowt31 = window.open('../tables/table3-1.shtml', 'windowt31', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt31.focus()">Table 3-1</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#17">17</A></SUP> These results strongly imply that tryptophan plays no role in the synthesis of melanin and that tyrosine is the common precursor of both eumelanin and phaeomelanin. The fact that tyrosine is incorporated at a reduced rate into yellow pigment may indicate that the normal sequence of events which lead to the synthesis of eumelanin by hair bulb melanocytes is permanently (e.g., in the case of <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>) or periodically (e.g. in the case of <I>A</I>) interrupted, or somehow diverted, resulting in a smaller polymer with altered physical properties (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe6">Wolfe and Coleman, 1966</A>). Indeed, the little that is known about the synthesis of phaeomelanin suggests that it is formed by a modification of the eumelanin pathway, involving the interaction of cysteine with dopaquinone (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Jimbow1">Jimbow <I>et al.</I>, 1976</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#18">18</A></SUP><A NAME="2ID"></A><H3>D. Role of Sulfhydryls in the Expression of Agouti Locus Alleles</H3><P>In 1963 Cleffmann reported that if pieces of skin from late embryos or from young mice of different agouti locus constitutions, including <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151;, were grown <I>in vitro</I>, hair growth continued and <I>eumelanin</I> was produced. From this Cleffman concluded that all melanocytes synthesize eumelanin under standard <I>in vitro</I> conditions. However, if sulfhydryl (SH) compounds such as glutathione were added to the nutrient medium all melanocytes, regardless of their age or genotype (provided of course that they were not from albino donors), could be induced to produce phaeomelanin. The minimum concentration of SH compounds which were required to induce the <I>in vitro</I> synthesis of phaeomelanin varied with the agouti locus genotype of the explant. <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> and <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/&#151; pigment cells required a significantly higher concentration of SH compounds throughout their entire period <I>in vitro</I> than <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151; melanocytes. On the other hand, <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151 and <I>A</I>/&#151; melanocytes displayed cyclic variations in their requirements of SH compounds. During that stage of the hair growth cycle when eumelanin was normally synthesized, a high level of SH compounds, equivalent to that required by <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> cells, was necessary to induce phaeomelanin synthesis, whereas during the period when the yellow band was being formed significantly fewer SH compounds were needed. Even more intriguing was the fact that Cleffmann claimed that the <I>in vitro</I> synthesis of phaeomelanin was not confined to the melanocytes of the hair bulb. The same <I>in vitro</I> conditions which promoted yellow pigment production in the hair follicle induced dermal melanocytes to synthesize phaeomelanin. This was surprising because this is <I>not</I> the case <I>in vivo</I>. Thus <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151; mice produce phaeomelanin <I>only</I> in a hair bulb environment; in other regions of the animal where melanin is produced, e.g., the eye, ear, tail, harderian gland etc., only eumelanin occurs (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert4">Markert and Silvers, 1956</A>). Cleffmann also observed that pigment cells which are synthesizing phaeomelanin take up more SH compounds and less melanin precursors ([<SUP>14</SUP>C]tyrosine, [<SUP>14</SUP>C]dopa) than eumelanin-producing cells and that these SH compounds are incorporated to a greater extent into phaeomelanin than into eumelanin (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann4">Cleffmann, 1964</A>). Because these results helped account for how the agouti locus operates, i.e., it somehow controlled the amount of SH compounds in the melanocyte, a number of hypotheses on <I>a</I>-locus gene expression have been based upon these findings (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Foster4">Foster, 1965</A>; <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Phillips9">R.J.S. Phillips, 1966a</A>; G.

Unfortunately, however, all of these hypotheses must be considered with caution since the original observations of Cleffmann await confirmation. Thus Knisely and his associates (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Knisely1">1975</A>) observed that neither <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> explants synthesized eumelanin under standard <I>in vitro</I> conditions, nor did <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> explants, in the eumelanin phase of pigment production, synthesize phaeomelanin when cultured in a concentration of glutathione which, according to Cleffmann (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann3">1963</A>), should have induced them to do so.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#19">19</A></SUP> Galbraith and Patrignani (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith5">1976</A>) have likewise failed to corroborate Cleffmann's (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann4">1964</A>) contention that yellow and black melanocytes differ according to their SH metabolism. They found that "yellow and black melanocytes, regardless of genotype, possess equivalent amounts of histochemically detectable sulfhydryl compounds."<A NAME="2IE"></A><H3>E. Action of Genes at the Agouti Locus</H3><P>The fact that in <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151; mice phaeomelanin appears to occur only in hair follicles (see <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers2">Silvers, 1957</A>),<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#20">20</A></SUP> as well as the observation that yellow and black granules occur in the same cell in <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> hair bulbs (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith1">Galbraith, 1964</A>;<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Geschwind4">Geschwind <I>et al.</I>, 1972</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Sakurai1">Sakurai <I>et al.</I>, 1975</A>), strongly suggest that the genes at the agouti locus act via the follicular environment. However, these findings do not constitute proof that this is the case. Proof requires evaluating the behavior of melanocytes of one agouti-locus genotype in hair follicles comprised of cells of a different agouti-locus constitution. Fortunately this situation can be achieved experimentally by transplanting histocompatible skin from near term or newborn donors to newborn recipients (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers7">Silvers, 1963</A>). This procedure takes advantage of the fact that when such grafts are made to neonatal recipients, some host melanoblasts migrate across the graft boundary and become established in the developing hair follicles of the graft (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Reed3">Reed and Sander, 1937</A>; <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Reed1">Reed, 1938</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Reed2">Reed and Henderson, 1940</A>). Thus employing this technique it was found that when intensely pigmented black mice of the genotype <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>C</I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I> (produced by crossing mice of an inbred color stock, <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I>;<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I> with C57BL/6, <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>C</I>/<I>C</I> animals) were grafted shortly after birth with neonatal skin from black-eyed white mice of the genotype <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I>;<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>, some intensely colored <I>yellow</I> hairs appeared among the nonpigmented hairs within the border of the graft. Conversely, when neonatal <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I> skin was transplanted to yellow-pigmented (<I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I>;<I>C</I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>) recipients, some intensely colored <I>black</I> hairs were found among the predominantly pale brown-pigmented hairs of the (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>) graft (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers9">Silvers and E. Russell, 1955</A>). Other experiments, utilizing the same technique, demonstrated that when agouti (but albino) skin was transplanted to either intensely pigmented yellow or black recipients, some hairs pigmented with the typical agouti pattern, i.e., black with a yellow band, arose among the albino hairs of the graft (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers4">Silvers, 1958b</A>).<P>While all of these studies were consistent with the hypothesis that it was the agouti locus constitution of the receiving hair follicle which determined the kind of melanin synthesized by the invading cell, nevertheless, because all the grafts, including those which were nonpigmented, possessed indigenous populations of melanocytes, one had to rule out the possibility that these indigenous populations were not being "turned on" by some chemical infiltrate of host origin. This possibility was eliminated by repeating some of these experiments with grafts from white spots. Inasmuch as white-spotting results from an absence of melanocytes (see <A HREF="chapter3-2.shtml#3IIA">Chapter 3, Section II, A</A>), such grafts do not possess any indigenous population that can be "turned on." the results employing these grafts not only confirmed the previous findings (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers9">Silvers and E. Russell, 1955</A>; Silvers, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers3">1958a</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers4">1958b</A>) but they indicated that the number of pigmented hairs within the border of "white spots" was usually greater than in transplants known to contain an indigenous melanoblast population. Evidently, in the latter case the melanoblasts of host origin have to compete with those of the graft for occupancy in hair bulbs.<P>Additional experiments with <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151; and <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/&#151; transplants demonstrated that the expression of <I>a</I>-locus genic activity depended not only upon the genotype of the follicular environment, but also upon the location of this environment on the integument. Thus when potentially intensely pigmented melanocytes of <I>any</I> agouti locus constitution invaded a dorsal, nonpigmented, <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> graft they produced intensely pigmented black hairs, whereas when those cells were introduced into ventral follicles of the same genotype, some all-yellow hairs as well as some yellow hairs with black bases (characteristic of the ventral hairs of many intensely pigmented black-and-tan genotypes) resulted (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers4">Silvers, 1958b</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#21">21</A></SUP> These observations, together with the finding that <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/&#151; and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151; melanocytes were likewise able to respond completely to the agouti locus genotype of the receiving hair follicle, implied that in <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/&#151; and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/&#151 mice ventrality and dorsality of location were not important per se but that, in conjunction with their genotype, they presented different follicular environments which influenced the expression of the melanocyte (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Silvers6">Silvers, 1961</A>). The results of these transplantation experiments are summarized in <a href="javascript:windowt24 = window.open('../tables/table2-4.shtml', 'windowt24', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt24.focus()">Table 2-4</A>.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#22">22</A></SUP><P>Once it was established that the genes at the agouti locus produce their effect by altering the follicular milieu the stage was set to locate more precisely the activity of these alleles. Inasmuch as hair follicles have both an epidermal and dermal component&#151;the epidermal ectoderm forms the epithelial portion of the follicle and the mesoderm the dermal papilla&#151attention was focused on which of these components was responsible for the agouti pattern. Mayer and Fishbane (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mayer9">1972</A>) and Poole (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Poole1">1974</A>) treated small pieces of skin, derived from the side of the trunk of 13- to 17-day-old <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> and <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> (or <I>A</I>/<I>A</I>) embryos, with trypsin so that the epidermis and dermis could be separated and recombined and allowed to differentiate in the testis of a histocompatible host or in a chick embryo. They found that when <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> dermis was recombined with <I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I>/<I>A<SUP>w</SUP></I> (or <I>A</I>/<I>A</I>) epidermis the hairs which differentiated did <I>not</I> display the agouti pattern. On the other hand, the reciprocal combination of agouti dermis and nonagouti epidermis always resulted in typical agouti hairs. These findings indicated that the genotype of the epidermal (ectodermal) component had no influence on the kind of pigment synthesized and that <I>a</I>-locus activity was mediated via the dermis. This conclusion had to be revised, however, when it was observed that recombinations of <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> with +/+, <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>, or <I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I> dermis produced hairs completely pigmented with phaeomelanin (Poole, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Poole1">1974</A>, <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Poole2">1975</A>). Indeed, yellow pigmented hairs were produced even in recombinations of "young" (13 day) embryonic yellow epidermis with "old" (17 day) <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> or <I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I> dermis: dermis in which dermal papillae were already present.<P>Further investigations demonstrated that only in <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/&#151 skin does <I>both</I> the epidermis and dermis induce the synthesis of phaeomelanin.<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#23">23</A></SUP> Thus the regional pigmentation pattern displayed by black-and-tan mice, like the agouti pattern, is determined by the dermis regardless of whether it is of ventral or dorsal origin (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Poole3">Poole and Silvers, 1976a</A>). Experimental recombinations of 14- to 16-day-old embryonic <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> ventral dermis and <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> dorsal epidermis give rise to yellow-pigmented hairs, whereas the reciprocal combination of dorsal dermis and ventral epidermis develop hairs pigmented with eumelanin. Black hairs are likewise produced when <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> dorsal dermis is combined with <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> ventral dermis or when <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> ventral dermis is associated with <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> ventral epidermis. This latter finding is especially revealing because it demonstrates that the epidermis of <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> ventral skin, unlike that of <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> skin, does not promote the synthesis of phaeomelanin (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Poole3">Poole and Silvers, 1976a</A>). It appears, therefore, that although yellow and black-and-tan animals have similar ventral phenotypes, only the <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I> allele can act via the dermal and epidermal components of the follicle to induce the formation of yellow hairs. A summary of the pigmentation of hairs obtained by recombining dermis and epidermis between <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>, <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> dorsal and ventral, and <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> ventral embryonic skin is presented in <a href="javascript:windowt25 = window.open('../tables/table2-5.shtml', 'windowt25', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt25.focus()">Table 2-5</A>. Obviously the combination of <I>both</I> dermal ventrality and the <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I> allele is necessary for the development of the black-and-tan ventral phenotype.<P>In spite of all the effort which has been directed toward investigating the action of genes at the agouti locus, the specific effect of this locus remains unknown. It was once proposed that the banding of agouti hairs was caused by the rate of hair growth, i.e., an elevated mitotic rate in the follicular matrix somehow promoted phaeomelanin synthesis (Cleffmann, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann1">1953</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann2">1960</A>, <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Cleffmann3">1963</A>). While this possibility was consistent with the observation that the agouti pattern could be altered by the administration of the mitotic inhibitor colchicine during the period of yellow band formation (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith1">Galbraith, 1964</A>), as well as with the fact that there was an association between the initiation of yellow banding in <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> mice with an increased mitotic rate in their hair follicles, this notion has had to be discarded. Thus the very meticulous analysis by Galbraith (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith3">1971</A>) has revealed clearly that <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> hair bulbs (as well as <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> bulbs) display an increased mitotic rate at the same phase of hair growth when the yellow band is forming in <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> animals. Indeed, genetically yellow and genetically black bulbs possess virtually identical mitotic rates at all stages of hair growth. Moreover, if there was a causal relationship between increased mitotic activity and yellow pigment production one would expect the cessation of phaeomelanin production in <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> hair bulbs to be associated with a <I>decreased</I> mitotic rate and this, too, does not occur. In fact, the rate of cell division during the return to eumelanin synthesis is, in most instances, higher than during band formation (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith3">Galbraith, 1971</A>).<SUP><A HREF="footnotes2.shtml#24">24</A></SUP><P>Galbraith and Arceci (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith4">1974</A>) have also shown that <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I> and <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> hair bulbs do not differ with respect to their melanocyte populations and so it is most unlikely that a fluctuation in the number of pigment cells during hair growth is responsible for the agouti pattern.<SUP>25</SUP> Actually the only factor which has been shown to be related to the synthesis of phaeomelanin in agouti mice is bulb mass. As <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> hair bulbs increase in size there is a loss in the capacity of their melanocyte populations to synthesize yellow pigment; no phaeomelanin is produced by <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> melanocytes in hair bulbs that exceed 110 microns in diameter (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Galbraith2">Galbraith, 1969</A>). Thus neither guard hairs nor the vibrissae show the agouti pattern.<P>While, as the above testifies, an abundant amount of information has been collected on the action of the <I>a</I>-locus genes, the crucial experiments defining the primary action of this locus have yet to be reported.<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="footnotes1.shtml">Previous</A></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="chapter2-2.shtml">Next</A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><PRE></PRE></body></html>
