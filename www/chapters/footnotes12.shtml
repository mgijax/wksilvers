However, according to him this classification "is complicated by the fact that contrary to statements in the literature, the color genes <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> and <I>d</I> also influence eye color very markedly." "In a normal (<I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I>) mouse, the choroidal vessels are hidden from view by the choroidal pigment; the pupil is jet-black and the schlera next to the cornea is opaque and slate-grey." On the other hand, in cinnamons (<I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>) and in dilute (<I>d</I>/<I>d</I>) animals the choroidal pigmentation near the fundus is somewhat diluted so that even adult animals show a dull red light reflex in their pupils. Gr&#252;neberg also states that <I>a</I>/<I>a</I> increases the amount of choroidal pigment; hence a chocolate mouse (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>)has much more pigment than a cinnamon (<I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>) animal. The influence which <I>mi</I>/+ has on the eye is similar to, but much stronger than, the diluting effect of <I>b</I>/<I>b</I>. "Thus a <I>mi</I>/+;<I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I> mouse shows a red pupillary reflex, and often the pigmentation is reduced in the periphery of the fundus so that the choroidal vessels are visible through a semi-transparent sclera near the corneal margin." In <I>mi</I>/+;<I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I> animals the pigmentation of the iris is also diluted so "that a ruby-colored reflex is generally visible in ordinary daylight with the naked eye." In Gr&#252;neberg's experience <I>mi</I>/+ can be distinguished from +/+ in the presence of <I>A</I>, <I>a</I>, <I>B</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>D</I>, and <I>d</I> on the basis of choroidal and iris pigmentation "except for rare errors in <I>A</I>/<I>A</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I> or <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I> mice" (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg11">Gr&#252;neberg, 1952</A>).<A NAME="3"></A><P><SUP>3</SUP>Because the spotting effect of <I>mi</I>/+ was discovered accidentally, Gr&#252;neberg's analysis of this condition was, in part, a retrospective one. Consequently he was not absolutely certain whether any of the three animals he originally mated showed minor spotting. It should be emphasized, however, that the <I>mi</I>/+ male employed in this mating came from Hertwig's original strain, a strain in which tail spotting or spotting elsewhere does not seem to have occurred at all (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg10">Gr&#252;neberg, 1948</A>).<A NAME="4"></A><P><SUP>4</SUP>Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">1970b</A>) found that all 20 ears he examined were affected. The abnormalities always were severe in the cochlea, but the saccule sometimes exhibited a fairly normal appearance, particularly in very young animals. In no instance was any section of the cochlea duct found to be normal, although the abnormalities were far from uniform throughout its length. The stria vascularis was abnormal in its entirety but small groups of hair cells occurred in the organ of Corti at scattered points. Degeneration of the spiral ganglion was not particularly severe, but this could have been attributed to the fact that no old animals were examined. Deol also observed the "severe dedifferentiation and cellular migrations occurred in the cochlear duct and the saccule in the majority of ears."<A NAME="5"></A><P><SUP>5</SUP>Briefly "the microphthalmic mouse has a mild hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia, an increased serum alkaline phosphatase and greatly increased bone and serum citrate" (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Murphy7">H. Murphy, 1973</A>). Although some animals are found with normal levels of these parameters, the severe osteopetrotic lesion is always present histologically. According to Murphy, 28% of the mice have a life expectancy in excess of 3 months which is much greater than the life expectancy of grey-lethal animals. As in the case of grey-lethal both thyroid and parathyroid endocrinopathies seem to be involved; at least many of the morphological, histological, and biochemical observations on these mutants can be explained by an increased secretion of calcitonin eliciting a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Murphy7">H. Murphy, 1973</A>). The osteopetrotic condition in microphthalmic mice can also be improved by parabiosis with normal mice (Walker, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Walker2">1972</A>, <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Walker3">1973</A>; <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Barnes1">Barnes <I>et al.</I>, 1975</A>) or by injecting cells from the spleen or marrow of normal animals into irradiated mutants (Walker <A HREF="../references4.shtml#Walker4">1975a</A>,<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Walker6">1975c</A>). Loutit and Sansom (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Loutit2">1976</A>) have been able to overcome the osteopetrotic defect of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> mice by injecting them intraperitoneally at birth, or intravenously at weaning or maturity, with cell suspensions containing hematopoietic stem cells from normal syngeneic (or H-2 compatible allogeneic) donors. Thus following this treatment resolution of much of the osteopetrosis but none of the other effects of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> occurred within a few months in the majority of cases. Moreover, irradiation of the recipients was <I>not</I> necessary to accomplish this "cure" (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Loutit1">Loutit, 1977</A>). These investigators believe that "osteoclasis of scaffold-type woven bone is impaired in <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I>" and "that osteoclastic cells are derived through circulating monocytes from hematopoietic stem cells." More recently Nisbet <I>et al.</I> (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Nisbet1">1978</A>) have shown that if microphthalmic mice are either inoculated intravenously with bone marrow cells from allogeneic (but H-2 compatible) donors (bearing a T-6 marker), or are placed in temporary parabiosis with such animals, some improvement of their condition occurs (blindness and failure of eruption of teeth are unaffected) despite the fact that <I>no</I> donor cells can subsequently be found. On the basis of these findings they believe that during their limited period of residence the normal cells may cause considerable resorption of bone by providing osteoclastic precursors, or, they may trigger "the recipient's osteoclasts into effective function, comparable to the T-B cell-cell interactions of immunology." In contrast to the situation when normal cells are given to <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> mice, osteopetrosis can be produced by inoculating spleen cells from mutants into lethally irradiated normal recipients (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Walker5">Walker, 1975b</A>). Raisz and his colleagues (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Raisz1">1977</A>) have determined the response of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> (and normal) long bones in organ culture to some known stimulators of osteoclastic bone resorption. Their results indicate that the congenital osteopetrotic condition stems from "a generalized defect in the function and hormonal response of osteoclasts and suggest that this cell line is separate from the osteoblast cell line which shows no impairment of hormonal response."<A NAME="6"></A><P><SUP>6</SUP>The gene originally was given the symbol <I>Wh</I> but was changed to <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> when its allelism with <I>mi</I> was demonstrated (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg12">Gr&#252;neberg, 1953</A>).<A NAME="7"></A><P><SUP>7</SUP>When <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ is combined with splotch (<I>Sp</I>/+) on a nonagouti background it produces a decided yellowing effect on the ventrum, almost like <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>, as well as some increase in white area. Although the combination <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+;<I>W<SUP>a</SUP></I>/+ produces typically a black-eyed white phenotype on some genetic backgrounds some pigment occurs, primarily on the rump and around the ears (but demonstrably less than in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+;<I>W</I>/+) (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander2">Hollander, 1959</A>).<A NAME="8"></A><P><SUP>8</SUP>Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">1970b</A>) found that pigment was present in about two-thirds of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ ears but even in these cases it was severely reduced and mostly found in the utricle.<A NAME="9"></A><P><SUP>9</SUP>The fact that <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice, which possess a good deal of pigment in the coat, display much severer inner ear abnormalities than in <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> animals, which are completely white, provides and excellent example of an <I>exception</I> to the rule that, in general, the abnormalities of the inner ear are related to coat color (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>). On the other hand, as already noted (see <A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#19">Chapter 10, note 19), the correlation between abnormalities of the inner ear and pigmentation of the inner ear is quite good (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">Deol, 1970b</A>).<A NAME="10"></A><P><SUP>10</SUP>Markert and Silvers (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Markert4">1956</A>) did not observe any choroidal pigment in either <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ or <I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>t</SUP></I>;<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice (see <a href="javascript:windowt101 = window.open('../tables/table10-1.shtml', 'windowt101', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt101.focus()">Table 10-1</A>). However, only a few animals were examined. Indeed, Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>) too found that in some <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice the entire choroid was unpigmented.<A NAME="11"></A><P><SUP>11</SUP>Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol8">1971</A>) found no melanocytes in the harderian gland of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice. "although in sections a few granules could occasionally be seen which might have been lightly melanized melanosomes."<A NAME="12"></A><P><SUP>12</SUP>The situation in the eye of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ provides further evidence that the tissue environment can influence the amount of pigment produced (see <A HREF="chapter10-1.shtml#10IE">Chapter 10, Section I, E</A>). Thus while the pigment cells in the choroid of these genotypes form little or no pigment, their kindred cells in the outer layer of the iris in the same eye produce considerable amounts, enough to give it a normal appearance in most instances. As a consequence of these observations Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>) concludes that there is evidently something in the tissue environment of the outer layer, presumably some melanogenesis-promoting factor or factors, which brings about a change in the behavior of the pigment cells contained therein.<A NAME="13"></A><P><SUP>13</SUP>Nevertheless, according to Wolfe and Coleman (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Wolfe5">1964</A>) there is some tyrosinase activity in 5-day-old <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> skin (see <a href="javascript:windowf121 = window.open('../figures/figure12-1.shtml', 'windowf121', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf121.focus()">Figure 12-1</A>) since the activity in this skin is greater than in albino (<I>c</I>/<I>c</I>) and extreme dilution (<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>e</SUP></I>) skin, skin in which tyrosinase is known to be absent or at very low concentration (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">Coleman, 1962</A>).<A NAME="14"></A><P><SUP>14</SUP>Gr&#252;neberg (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg12">1953</A>) points out that when the iris is pigmented, "careful inspection usually reveals the presence of a very slender pigment ring even through the closed eyelids at birth." He also draws attention to the fact that "the situation is like that in a normal 12-day embryo which has a pigment ring in the iris, but no melanin anywhere else."<A NAME="15"></A><P><SUP>15</SUP>As pointed out by Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol6">1970b</A>) the fact that <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> mice are like <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> genotypes in terms of "external spotting" but much more like <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ as regards "internal spotting" again indicates that there is often little or no relationship between the two.<A NAME="16"></A><P><SUP>16</SUP>Because <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ mice very occasionally display intensely pigmented "spots" (see <A HREF="footnotes10.shtml#28">Chapter 10, note 28</A>), and because Hertwig (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hertwig1">1942a</A>, <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hertwig2">1942b</A>) noted that the tips of the whiskers of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi</I> homozygotes tend to be bent, one must consider the possibility that the <I>mi</I>-locus is a complex one involving, in addition to inviable melanoblast clones, two phenotypic colors of viable clones and two hair follicle phenoclones (see <A HREF="../references3.shtml#Mintz8">Mintz, 1971a</A>). This conclusion is supported further by the interaction of certain <I>mi</I>-alleles, namely, <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I> with <I>mi<SUP>bw</SUP></I>, <I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I>, and <I>mi<SUP>ws</SUP></I>.<A NAME="17"></A><P><SUP>17</SUP>Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>) reports "in the iris the outer layer was unpigmented, but the inner layer always had some pigment, although it was unevenly distributed and much below normal in density." He also draws attention to the fact that the cells of this inner layer are derived from the retina which is almost completely unpigmented.<A NAME="18"></A><P><SUP>18</SUP>Deol (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Deol9">1973</A>) emphasizes the fact that because the identification of the amelanotic <I>retinal</I> pigment cell is beyond doubt, and very few of these cells in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi</I> heterozygotes form any pigment, that the widespread assumption that melanoblasts which fail to differentiate do not survive does not appear to be well founded, or at least is not invariably correct. While Deol's conclusion cannot be refuted this particular argument is not very convincing. Thus it is difficult to accept his premise that merely because the retinal cells of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi</I> fail to produce melanin they must be considered undifferentiated.<A NAME="19"></A><P><SUP>19</SUP>Gr&#252;neberg points out that a similar situation is found in the dominant spotting (<I>W</I>) series (<A HREF="chapter10-1.shtml">Chapter 10, Section I</A>). The anemia of <I>W</I>/<I>W</I> animals is much more severe than that of <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/<I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> mice; yet <I>W</I>/+ heterozygotes are not anemic while <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I>/+ mice are slightly so. Furthermore, <I>W<SUP>v</SUP></I> "dilutes" the fur when heterozygous with the normal allele and <I>W</I> does not. The basis for these different effects is not known.<A NAME="20"></A><P><SUP>20</SUP>As pointed out by Wolfe and Coleman (see also <A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hollander5">Hollander, 1968</A>), the fact that <I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I> is expressed only when heterozygous with other alleles (but not +) makes it appear, at least superficially, like the <I>t</I>-<I>T</I> (tailless-Brachyury) relationship. The <I>T</I>/<I>t</I> complex is composed of a class of semidominant <I>T</I> mutations which, when heterozygous, produce a short tail and when homozygous are lethal. <I>T</I> mutations interact with recessive alleles at this locus to produce a tailless (<I>T</I>/<I>t</I>) phenotype; this interaction makes it possible to detect recessive <I>t</I> alleles that would otherwise go unnoticed (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Artzt1">Artzt and Bennett, 1975</A>; see <A HREF="../references1.shtml#Bennett2">D. Bennett, 1975</A>).<A NAME="21"></A><P><SUP>21</SUP>Wolfe and Coleman draw attention to the fact that <I>mi</I> was in the process of being backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J background when employed in these crosses, and that the faint dorsal pigmentation of <I>mi</I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I> animals present in early crosses was not observed in animals of this same genotype subsequent to generation 4, all hair being devoid of pigment at this stage.<A NAME="22"></A><P><SUP>22</SUP>Although it appears in <a href="javascript:windowf121 = window.open('../figures/figure12-1.shtml', 'windowf121', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf121.focus()">Figure 12-1</A> that <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ may differ significantly from <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I>, this difference could be due to the fact that in some cases the pieces of <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I> dorsal skin assayed overlapped some faintly visible white spots which may have reduced the counts. Indeed, counts from <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I> were about the same as those from <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/+ in three samples in which white spotted areas were carefully avoided.<A NAME="23"></A><P><SUP>23</SUP>Since there are apparently no differences in the attributes of the pigment granules in <I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I>/+, <I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I>, and +/+ genotypes, one must account for the differences in the activity of tyrosinase in the skins of these animals. To account for this Wolfe and Coleman suggest that "there is a threshold level for tyrosinase incorporation, above which full pigmentation can occur." A similar suggestion was made by Coleman (<A HREF="../references1.shtml#Coleman2">1962</A>) to account for the activity of the alleles at the albino (<I>c</I>) locus. The data suggest that this threshold falls between 640 and 898 cpm (see <a href="javascript:windowf121 = window.open('../figures/figure12-1.shtml', 'windowf121', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf121.focus()">Figure 12-1</A>) compared to 600 cpm for the albino-locus series of alleles (see <a href="javascript:windowt35 = window.open('../tables/table3-5.shtml', 'windowt35', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt35.focus()">Table 3-5</A>).<A NAME="24"></A><P><SUP>24</SUP>It should be stressed that although the pigment granules in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi<SUP>sp</SUP></I> hairs are yellow-brown when viewed by transmitted white light, they are nevertheless noticeably different from the small, round yellow granules produced by agouti locus alleles and by recessive yellow (<I>e</I>/<I>e</I>).<A NAME="25"></A><P><SUP>25</SUP>Another example where <I>mi</I>-locus alleles when heterozygous produce an effect different than when either allele is homozygous occurs in <I>Mi<SUP>wh</SUP></I>/<I>mi</I> animals. Thus these heterozygotes are <I>less</I> microphthalmic than either parental homozygote (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Gruneberg11">Gr&#252;neberg, 1952</A>).<A NAME="26"></A><P><SUP>26</SUP>An <I>mi</I> mutant also appeared spontaneously in the CBA/CaCrc inbred colony. Animals heterozygous for this mutation have less iris pigment than normal at birth. They also have nonpigmented tail tips and may display white spotting on the belly, but not the head. Homozygotes are devoid of pigment in the hair and eyes. The eyes are small and the eyelids do not open. The teeth of homozygotes fail to erupt and they are osteopetrotic. There is also a significant deviation from the expected segregation ratio when heterozygotes are mated, a deviation which appears to be due to the death of microphthalmic female embryos before or soon after implantation, Homozygotes of both sexes are sterile. In matings of heterozygotes with <I>mi</I>/+ mice, microphthalmic young occur which are indistinguishable from animals homozygous for the new mutation. It therefore seems likely that the new deviant represents a remutation to <I>mi</I>. Accordingly, it has been designated <I>mi<SUP>Crc</SUP></I> (<A HREF="../references2.shtml#Hetherington1">Hetherington, 1976</A>).<A NAME="27"></A><P><SUP>27</SUP>In this regard it is of interest to note that in the tests with the <I>Fk</I>/+ males, both a slightly reduced implantation frequency and a somewhat higher rate of intrauterine death were observed. These, however, were <I>not</I> statistically significant.<A NAME="28"></A><P><SUP>28</SUP>One of the most significant influences on spotting occurred when <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I> was substituted for <I>a</I> in the presence of <I>W<SUP>j</SUP></I>/+ as such a substitution reduced the amount of white in the coat from approximately 26 to about 4% (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Lamoreux3">Lamoreux and E.

In the case of flexed-tailed, 95% of <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>f</I>/<I>f</I> mice displayed white spotting while only 23% of <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>/<I>a</I>;<I>f</I>/<I>f</I> animals had spots (<A HREF="../references3.shtml#Lamoreux1">Lamoreux, 1973</A>).

Russell and Major (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell32e">1957</A>), for detecting genetic alterations in the somatic cells of mice. This test, known as "the mammalian spot test", involves treating mouse embryos, heterozygous for different recessive coat color genes, in utero, at 7-10 days gestation, with mutagens. These agents either are injected into the peritoneal cavity of the mother or are given to her orally. If this treatment results in an alteration, or loss, in a melanoblast of the wild-type allele of one of the genes under study a color spot is produced in the adult coat. Employing this test it has been found that (1) the frequencies of color spots in mutagen-treated animals depend upon the mutagens employed (<A HREF="../references4.shtml#Russell32e">L.
