The inactive X-chromosome in cells of the early embryo is represented by a circle and the active one by a rod. Light areas of the coat stem from regions in which the X-chromosome bearing the mutant gene <I>Mo</I> is active within melanocytes [and the X-chromosome bearing the normal (+) allele is inactive]. In the dark areas, the revese situation prevails and the X-chromosome bearing the + allele is active within melanocytes. The grey area designates regions where a significant intermingling of the two types of melanoblasts has occurred during development. Adapted from M.F. Lyon (<A HREF="../frames/frameLyon8.shtml" TARGET="_blank">1963</A>).</body></html>
