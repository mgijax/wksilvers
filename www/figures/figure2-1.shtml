The <I>A</I>/&#151; genotype does not segregate in this stock, but has been included since its expression includes a slight amount of phenotypic variablity in the form of small black or yellowish areas in the coat-color pattern of some inbred <I>A</I>/<I>A</I> mice. The all-black mice and agouti animals which occur in the VYm stock are phenocopies of the <I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I>/<I>a<SUP>e</SUP></I> and <I>A</I>/&#151; coat-color phenotypes. From G.
