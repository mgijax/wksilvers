The large masses are medullary cells while the streaks of granules are from the overlying cortex. In this drawing, the yellow phaeomelanin granules of the <I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I> mouse are symbolized by open circles; no distinction is made pretween black and brown eumelanin. In the medullary cells of yellow mice the nucleus is usually visible. Note that whereas the granules in intensely pigmented black (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I>) hairs are usually either long-oval or oval, those in brown (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>) hairs are round. Note also that the substitution of <I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I>/<I>c<SUP>ch</SUP></I> for <I>C</I>/<I>C</I> (on an <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>B</I>/<I>B</I> background) results in a diminution of granule size and not number. Finally note the clumping of granules in the <I>d</I>/<I>d</I> hair and the shred-shaped granules in the <I>p</I>/<I>p</I> shaft. These drawings were made by Dr. E.S. Russell and appeared in H.
