Lowrie (<A HREF="../frames/frameLutzner2.shtml" TARGET="_blank">1972</A>). The melanofilament (A) is 30 &#197; thick, coiled into a helix with an axial diameter of 90 &#197; and a pitch of 150 &#197;. This melanofilament thickens (B) and becomes more electron dense. It thickens even more approaching a tubule in contour (C). The early melanotubule (C) at this stage has an axial diameter of 400 &#197;, which widens eventually to 600 &#197; in diameter (D) The walls of this mature melanosome (D) are 200 &#197; thick and the lumen is about 200 &#197; in diameter. This mature melanotubule represents a 20-fold increase over the diameter of the melanofilament. Crossovers within the lumen of the melanotubule may be a helix with the same approximate dimensions as the melanofilament. Mature melanotubules may partially fuse as shown in (E).
