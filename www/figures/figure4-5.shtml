The melanocytes have a nucleofugal morphology in accord with their own genotype but in contrast to the genotype of the host. Approx. x970. (b) Nucleopetal melanocytes recovered from a graft of <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>;<I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I> 10-day-old embryonic dorsal tissue to the eye of a nonleaden albino host. The shape of the melanocytes is in accord with their own genotype but in contrast to that of the host. Approx. x450. (c) Melanocytes recovered from a graft of <I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>b</I>/<I>b</I>;<I>d</I>/<I>d</I> 12-day-old embryonic dorsal tissue to the eye of a nondilute abino host. These pigment cells exhibit a typical nucleofugal morphology although their own genotype is nucleopetal. The behavior of these cells is in striking contrast to those shown in (b), and is presumably due to the peculiar physical properties of the graft site. From C.L. Markert and W.K.
