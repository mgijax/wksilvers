In (a) the fibriller nature of the premelanosome is seen. The filaments (F) are spaced about 200 &#197; from each other. The pitch of the helices seen in these filaments (arrows) is about 150 &#197;. Approx. x 40,000. In (b) a partial melanization of the filaments has occurred and the limiting membrane (M) of the organelle can be seen. Approx. x46,000. In (c) melanin deposition is almost complete but filaments can still be resolved, particularly near the center of the granule. Circular electron lucent areas, with a diameter of 200-300 &#197, are evident near the periphery of the granule. Approx. x25,000. From V.J.
