Approx. x300. (a) Hair from an intense black (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>) mouse. Note the regular banded arrangement of melanin granules within the medulla. (b) Hair from a dilute black (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>d</I>/<I>d</I>) mouse. Several small clumps of melanin granules disrupt the otherwise normal pattern of pigment distribution. (c) Another hair from a dilute black animal but in this case showing a region containing an unusually large clump of melanin. This clump of pigment is only partially surrounded by the hair shaft but remains anchored to it. (d) Hair from a pink-eyed leaden (<I>a</I>/<I>a</I>;<I>p</I>/<I>p</I>;<I>ln</I>/<I>ln</I>) mouse. A large medullary clump of melanin is evident as a swelling in the terminal portion of the hair shaft. From <A HREF="../frames/frameMcGrath1.shtml" TARGET="_blank">E.P. McGrath and W.C.
