Note that while the <I>W<SUP>f</SUP></I> homozygote exhibits extensively depigmented areas lacking any well-defined pattern, the <I>W<SUP>f</SUP></I>/+ heterozygote (on the C3H/He background) is characterized by sharply limited white spots on the forehead and on the belly as well as a white tail tip. These spots are variable in size and sometimes reduced to a few white hairs.
